<h2>Chersonesos ARK</h2> 
<p>This is the static, archival version of the interactive ARK database constructed for the joint <a href="https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/ica/">Institute of Classical Archaeology</a>-<a href="http://chersonesos.org/">National Preserve of Tauric Chersonesos</a> excavations in the South Region of <a href="https://chersonesos-sev.ru/">Crimean Chersonesos</a> between 2001 and 2006. The site replicates the form and content of the original, which will be located <a href="https://ica.tacc.utexas.edu/chersonesos/ark">here</a> until it can no longer be maintained, but does not include the dynamic search, display, and export functionality of the interactive version.</p>
<p>To compensate for the loss of that functionality, and to ensure the reusability of the data, a series of static exports are also available. A complete serialization in JSON-LD can be found <a href="https://ica.tacc.utexas.edu/chersonesos/ark/data/data.json">here</a>. Full exports in CSV format of the various data categories can be found <a href="http://example.org">here</a>. The spatial data for the state plan, context extents and details, and small find locations in GeoJSON and shapefile format can be found <a href="https://ica.tacc.utexas.edu/chersonesos/ark/data/mapping/">here</a>, and an interactive online map with the full spatial data from the project will be maintained <a href="http://example.org">here</a> as long as it is possible to do so. All text, tabular, and vector data from the project have been also been deposited in the <a href="https://dataverse.tdl.org/dataverse/utexas">Texas Data Repository Dataverse</a> for long-term preservation and access. The original image resources, including raster data for the site GIS and photographic sets used for digital photogrammetry and RTI, are currently held in <a href="http://web.corral.tacc.utexas.edu/ICA/ChersonesosSouth/ChersonesosSouth_ARK/">an iRODS storage system at the Texas Advanced Computing Center</a>.</p>
<p>Additional information about the project and context for this data can be found at <a href="https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/ica/projects/chersonesos/introduction.php">ICA's website</a>, in <a href="https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/ica/publications/reports.php">ICA's Annual Reports for 2001-2011</a>, in our <a href="https://chersonesos.la.utexas.edu/">digital companion to ICA's work at Chersonesos</a>, which houses the linked Wordpress site containing excavation diary entries for the 2004-2006 seasons, and in the <a href="http://example.org">final publication of the South Region excavations</a>. Funding for the development of ARK in the context of the Chersonesos excavations was provided over many years through the generous support of the <a href="https://packhum.org/">Packard Humanities Institute</a>; funding for the final conversion of the South Region ARK to this archival format was provided by a grant from <a href="https://whitelevy.fas.harvard.edu/">the Shelby White and Leon Levy Program for Archaeological Publications</a>.</p>

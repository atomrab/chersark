		href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/226564">http://pleiades.
		stoa.org/places/226564</a>), 2001-2006, from topsoil down. This
		narrative was constructed during post-excavation study from
		notebooks, graphic documentation, and database records. The
		current written version was begun in the fall of 2014. It takes
		the forms of text chunked by room (of the final Byzantine
		building, our smallest spatial unit for recording purposes) and
		phase, so that the reader can construct a customized narrative
		for a particular area or time-period. The text can also be read
		as a single continuous narrative.]]></wp:category_description>

		synthetic narrative account of the stratigraphic record in the
		South Region excavation area, 2001-2006, from topsoil down. This
		narrative was constructed during post-excavation study from
		notebooks, graphic documentation, and database records. The
		current written version was begun in the fall of 2014. It takes
		the forms of text chunked by room (of the final Byzantine
		building, our smallest spatial unit for recording purposes) and
		phase, so that the reader can construct a customized narrative
		for a particular area or time-period. The text can also be read
		as a single continuous narrative.]]></content:encoded>

		([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_336])</span> <em><span class="tx f9">[it

		Context&nbsp;</span><span class="tx">numbers are also assigned
		to destruction/collapse layers in rooms 32 (SR338) ([ark_link
		cxt=CH04SR_338]) and 33 (SR337) ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_337]).
		</span><span class="tx">Tile will be quantified by volume,
		according to the number of buckets filled for each

		diameter]</em> at the bottom, 26cm high (variation in buckets is
		+/- 10-15%). The number of&nbsp;</span><span class="tx">buckets
		for each layer will be recorded on its context sheet.</span>

<span class="tx">Shawn, Clay and Sam begin to excavate SR338 in room 32.
The layer of collapse in room 29&nbsp;</span><span class="tx">(SR339)
([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_339]) also begins to be excavated; a baulk is left
approximately 80cm from the NW wall of </span><span class="tx">the room
to provide an internal section.</span>

<span class="tx">The layers of collapse extend to a greater depth than
it initially appeared. An interlude of&nbsp;</span><span
class="tx">excavation with trowels is followed by a return to large
picks. At</span>

<em>[p. 4]</em>

<span class="tx">the same time, work begins on the NW extension of the
trench. Topsoil is assigned the same&nbsp;</span><span class="tx">number
it bore during the 2001 excavations (PA001) ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_1])
and excavated to a depth of 5-10cm. By </span><span class="tx">the end
of the day, only small areas at each end of the NW extension have been
removed.</span>

<span class="tx">A conversation about small finds results in a change of
the small-find identification and&nbsp;</span><span class="tx">recording
system. Larissa and I agree that glass should be treated collectively by
layer, with the&nbsp;</span><span class="tx">exception of diagnostic
pieces. Nails and undifferentiated metal objects will also be treated
as&nbsp;</span><span class="tx">groups&nbsp;</span><em><span class="tx
f9">[after conversation with conservators, this was later revised to the
collective treatment of&nbsp;</span><span class="tx f9">nails only, with
all other metal objects treated as special finds]</span></em><span
class="tx">, although here we will attempt a&nbsp;</span><span
class="tx">compromise between the preservation of information and the
time-consuming work of small-find&nbsp;</span><span
class="tx">recording. Each nail will still be mapped with the total
station, and a short list of characteristics&nbsp;</span><span
class="tx">(mostly binary&nbsp;</span><span class="tx
f714">–</span><span class="tx">&nbsp;short/long, round head/square head
etc.) entered into the data collector. These&nbsp;</span><span
class="tx">nails, however, will no longer be treated as individual small
finds. &nbsp;This shift will take effect on&nbsp;</span><span
class="tx">Wednesday 23/6<em>&nbsp;</em></span><em><span class="tx
f9">[several nails prior to this date were treated as small finds,
according to the&nbsp;</span><span class="tx f9">previous
system]</span></em><span class="tx">.</span>]]></content:encoded>

overcut during </span><span class="tx">excavation </span><span class="tx
f714">–</span><span class="tx"> in addition to topsoil, a certain amount
of rubble (mainly disturbed/modern) is also </span><span

([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_340]) and removal of the remains of 336 ([ark_link

class="tx">In the NW extension, excavation of topsoil continues. In room
28, layer 340 ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_340]) continues to be </span><span
class="tx">cleaned.  It varies in color from a lighter ashy gray to a
dark gray-brown, but both consistency </span><span class="tx">(soft but
compact, slightly clayey) and inclusions (much charcoal, some small
rocks, bones) are </span><span class="tx">more or less the same across
the layer. There is a concentration of bone of various
large </span><span class="tx">ruminants located roughly 1m from the NW
wall, about equidistant from the SW and NE walls. </span><span
class="tx">There is also a pile of yellowish compact soil (SR347)
([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_347]) in the area of the doorway; it appears
to </span><span class="tx">cover 340 ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_340]).</span>

<em><span class="tx f9">[p. 9: sketch plan of SR340 ([ark_link
cxt=CH04SR_340]), SR347 ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_347]), and area of bones
in room 28; sketch plan at roughly 1:50 of </span><span class="tx
f9">pile of apparent in situ tile collapse in room 32]</span></em>

<em>[p. 10]</em>

<span class="tx">In rm 32, the area to the NE is cleaned and the
remaining SR338 ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_338]) removed in an attempt to
clarify </span><span class="tx">the nature of the line of stones
tentatively identified as a wall along the NE side of the
room. </span><span class="tx">Excavation is a bit aggressive, but for
the most part the soil removed seems to be consistent with </span><span
class="tx">338 in the rest of the room.</span>

<span class="tx">In rm 29, another disturbance (or the lower part of a
disturbance) appears in the E corner of the </span><span
class="tx">room. It is filled with a soft, loose, dark brown soil with
very few rocks and almost no ceramic </span><span class="tx">material
(SR344 ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_344]), filling SR345 ([ark_link
cxt=CH04SR_345])). After a moment in which the base of a pot was
mistaken (by </span><span class="tx">me) for the base of a[n artillery]
shell, the intrusion began to seem life another root or
animal </span><span class="tx">disturbance. In the rest of the room, 339
([ark_link cxt=CH04SR])continued to be removed from a thick layer of
tile </span><span class="tx">collapse.</span>]]></content:encoded>

excavated. In its lower reaches are more charcoal
inclusions, </span><span class="tx">tiles, and at least one chunk of
yellow clay that might represent unbaked mudbrick or perhaps
the </span><span class="tx">sealing layer of a ceiling or roof. The
surface below ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_354]) seems relatively consistent
and hard-</span><span class="tx">packed, but is not level </span><span

between stones, </span><span class="tx">and there is a strong
possibility that the area between this wall and the NE section has
been </span><span class="tx">subject to modern disturbance to deep
levels.</span>

<span class="tx">In room 29, a confusion is resolved </span><span
class="tx f714">–</span><span class="tx"> the layer of tile over the

morning. Today’s bags are corrected; Saturday’s will be dealt with in
the pot </span><span class="tx">shed. There seems to be a layer of soft,
compact greenish-gray soil similar to 341 ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_341])
under the tile </span><span class="tx">layer; it also has tiles lying
flat over it, but somewhat more charcoal and several large
fragments </span><span class="tx">of pottery, including a pithos
apparently broken in situ against the W corner of the section
and </span><span class="tx">the SW wall. It is cleaned and will be
photographed; drawing will probably be digitization from </span><span

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Topsoil cleaning
continues in the NE extension – several paths  <em>[p. 16]</em>  have
been left for barrows but will be removed when work ends in the three
rooms currently under excavation.  In rooms 32 and 29, the lower layers
of tile collapse are cleaned off to reveal beaten-earth floors with some
vessels broken in situ.  The roof or ceiling composition is very well
represented – apart from tiles, there are quantities of sea-grass,
apparently used as fill or insulation, and large spots of yellow pebbly
clay, perhaps also sealant.  A sample of sea-grass is saved.  In room
32, there is also a lump of clay with a corroded mass of metal on top of
it (lifted as a group and sent to conservation).  In room 29, [ark_link
cxt=CH04SR_351] comes down onto a hard-packed surface, as in room 32, on
which sit a large number of articulated vessels apparently broken in
situ.  The remainder of [ark_link cxt=CH04SR_351] (also containing large
quantities of sea-grass) is removed and the vessels cleaned to be
photo’d for georeferencing,  A large flat stone on the floor of 32, in
the E corner, is removed initially as part of the collapse.  It becomes
clear, however, that it sat directly on the floor and was covered by the
tile fall, and so is put back into position (with precision, since a
ridge on the bottom matches a dip in the floor surface).  Some confusion
in rm 28 – along the NE side of the room, the soil has a yellower tinge.
 After some discussion, we decide that it is still a part of [ark_link
cxt=CH04SR_340], with inclusions from more friable stones.  It may be
that the yellow is in fact part of or related to [ark_link
cxt=CH04SR_349], but if so the relationship has already been seriously
confused and the finds contaminated.  Material is kept as [ark_link
cxt=CH04SR_340].  <em>[p. 18]</em>  Rm 28, burnt layer [ark_link
cxt=CH04SR_352] finally cleaned and drawn (some irregularities – doesn’t
cover whole area of room).  In situ pots removed from the floor of rm
32.  In situ pots in rm 29 cleaned for georef[erencing] photo; there
were 4 coins ([ark_link sfi=CH04SR_2146], [ark_link sfi=CH04SR_2147],
[ark_link sfi=CH04SR_2157], [ark_link sfi=CH04SR_2160]) found just over
the floor in this room, as well as a nearly-intact green-glaze jug
([ark_link sfi=CH04SR_2158]) and a number of pithoi/coarse jars. 
Conservators deal with large chunks of burnt wood [in room 28] in an
effort to preserve them intact.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Stable teams are
established: Shawn will deal with documentation for NW extension,
working with Glenn, Kate, Allyson, Misha and Yuri. Clay will take care
of documentation for rooms 28, 29 and 32 (Anja, Alla, Genya; Sasha and
Dyma; and Anton, Andrei, and Karina, respectively). Sam will assign
context numbers and keep the register.

In room 28, collapse [ark_link cxt=CH04SR_336] is excavated for a short
time, but then we turn to the definition of the relationship between the
gray ashy layer at the SW end of the room [ark_link cxt=CH04SR_340] and
the collapse. [ark_link cxt=CH04SR_340] appears to fall off steeply and

<em>[p. 6]</em>

is covered by [ark_link cxt=CH04SR_336]. The limit of [ark_link
cxt=CH04SR_336] is irregular – about 50cm from the all in the W corner,
about 1.2m in the S corner. Once the boundary between the layers is
defined, [ark_link cxt=CH04SR_336] will continue to be removed, starting
from the SW.

In room 32, the collapse seems to be coming down on a layer of tile
collapse, albeit a poorly defined one. The collapse produces several
articulated sherds/vessel fragments and a number of nails (shot in
according to the new system, although a context # code was not added
until mid-morning). The area of the door between 32 and 29 is determined
to be collapse, not blocking, and is excavated as [ark_link
cxt=CH04SR_338]. A grindstone appears in the S corner of the room.

In room 29, there seems to be a disturbed area in the center of the room
(pebbles and lots of snails <em>[i.e. land snail shells]</em>, perhaps
indicating a void or loose fill). Preliminary examination suggests a
modern pit, especially since a piece of modern fabric <em>[this may
actually have been root material]</em> was extracted from the soil. The
room is cleaned in an attempt to define the edge of the pit.

In the NW extension, removal of topsoil continues. Finds include much
modern material, among which fragments of a Nazi porcelain plate
<em>[Bayern maker’s stamp with swastika and eagle </em><em>wings]</em>.
The tops of the walls visible in the 2002 trench appear along the same
line.

Rm 32, layer [ark_link cxt=CH04SR_338] produces a grindstone at the
corner of the steps up into yard 1. It is not clear if it is in situ, on
supports of convenient stones, or part of the general collapse. In room
28, layer slopes steeply down below [ark_link cxt=CH04SR_336], which
continues to be removed. In room 29, the edges of the intrusion in the
center of the room are defined, to be cleaned, photographed and drawn
tomorrow.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<span
class="tx">Room 32&nbsp;</span><span class="tx">has been finished.
&nbsp;The floor of room 29 ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_364]) is cleaned; there
may be a ring of stones </span><span class="tx">(perhaps to support the
base of the pithos collapsed in situ in this area). &nbsp;The cleaning
of this </span><span class="tx">floor goes a bit deep toward the section
left in place; in that area a coin ([ark_link sf=CH04SR_2162]) is found.
</span><span class="tx">Dyma excavated it and is sure that it formed
part of the surface deposit ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_355]) on the floor of
the room, </span><span class="tx">but it is also possible that the coin
was in the fabric of the floor (possible dating element for floor
</span><span class="tx">construction).</span>

<span class="tx">Excavations of topsoil and modern fill in NE extension
continues; barrow paths begin to be </span><span class="tx">removed.
&nbsp;In NW extension, we begin to remove collapse in small room
30&nbsp;</span><span class="tx f9"><em>[there must be some
</em></span><em><span class="tx f9">confusion in my notebook
here&nbsp;</span><span class="tx f718">–</span><span class="tx
f9">&nbsp;31 is the small room&nbsp;</span><span class="tx

be </span></em><span class="tx f9"><em>accurate]</em></span><span
class="tx"> ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_358]) and in rm 31 ([ark_link
cxt=CH04SR_359]&nbsp;</span><span class="tx f714">–</span><span
class="tx">&nbsp;both these layers will be combined with equivalent
layers </span><span class="tx">from 2000-2002). </span>

<span class="tx">There is an infant or fetus deposition ([ark_link
cxt=CH04SR_360]) in the S corner of rm 28, apparently placed in a
shallow cut ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_361]) </span><span class="tx">through
the floor and perhaps through bedrock. The floor may actually have been
overexcavated </span><span class="tx">in that area, so there is some
question about the phasing of this deposition&nbsp;</span><span
class="tx f714">–</span><span class="tx">&nbsp;was it pre-floor in
</span><span class="tx">association with the church, or was it cut into
the floor after the room was built and used?&nbsp;</span><span class="tx
f9"><em>[after </em></span><em><span class="tx f9">going back and forth
on the stratigraphy here several times, my feeling as of 11 July is that
the </span></em><span class="tx f9"><em>grave was cut through floor and
destruction layers after the abandonment of the house – see
below]</em></span>

<span class="tx f9">[p. 20]</span>

<span class="tx">The bones are not in good order and the body is only
partially complete&nbsp;</span><span class="tx f714">–</span><span
class="tx">&nbsp;preservation is further </span><span
class="tx">compromised by the fact that someone came last night and dug
up and disturbed several parts of </span><span class="tx">the skull. The
fill of the tomb is a soft dark gray-brown soil with large inclusions of
bedrock </span><span class="tx">fragments and charcoal ([ark_link
cxt=CH04SR_360]). </span>

<span class="tx">The deposition is cleaned and photographed. &nbsp;At
the same time, the stones placed over the floor </span><span
class="tx">of the church are removed in preparation for the excavation
of tomb 2. Increasing rain, </span><span class="tx">however, cuts the
excavation day short. We have a short presentation of the data
collecting </span><span class="tx">system at Dacha 1 and then stop for
the day. </span>]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<span
class="tx">Work begins on the second tomb in the
church&nbsp;</span><span class="tx f714">–</span><span
class="tx">&nbsp;the brown soil that fills it is SR362 ([ark_link
cxt=CH04SR_362]) . &nbsp;Renata, </span><span class="tx">Irina and Alla
begin. &nbsp;In room 28, we begin to remove 352 ([ark_link
cxt=CH04SR_352]) along the NW wall of the room, </span><span
class="tx">moving SE, and in the N corner, where a collection of beams
is cleaned to be photographed and </span><span class="tx">removed by
conservators. 352 ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_352]) has a large number of
burnt and very fragmentary tiles and ranges </span><span class="tx">in
color from deep black to an ashy gray or gray-</span><span class="tx
f714">brown. &nbsp;I’m beginning to have doubts about
the&nbsp;</span><span class="tx">phasing of the tomb in the
corner&nbsp;</span><span class="tx f714">–</span><span
class="tx">&nbsp;the black seems to run deeper than I thought, and the
relation </span><span class="tx">between the two should probably be
reexamined. </span>

<span class="tx">The NE and NW extensions now have enough visible walls
to be divided into rooms. &nbsp;In rooms </span><span class="tx">30 and
31, work continues; in 30, the collapse of large stones ([ark_link
cxt=CH04SR_358]) seems to come down onto a </span><span
class="tx">collapse composed of tiles and smaller stones. &nbsp;In room
31, a NW wall seems to have been </span><span
class="tx">identified&nbsp;</span><span class="tx f714">–</span><span
class="tx">&nbsp;</span><span class="tx f714">but as I’m writing, it
appears to turn into the stone base for a flight of stairs.</span>

<span class="tx">In new rooms 35 ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_374]) and 36
([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_373]), modern disturbance seems to come down,
across an uncertain interface, </span><span class="tx">onto rubble
collapse. &nbsp;The modern disturbance is quite deep in many places.
</span>

<span class="tx f9"><em>[p. 24]</em> </span>

<span class="tx">2/7 cont. </span><span class="tx">In room 28, the area
of burnt beams in the N corner of the room is fully cleaned and
</span><span class="tx">georeferencing photos are taken. &nbsp;Allyson
also draws a sketch plan on which 11 different beams </span><span
class="tx">or sections of beams are labeled, to facilitate drawing; then
each of those eleven pieces are given </span><span class="tx
f714">“other find” shots from the total station. &nbsp;Samples will be
taken and identified by the total station </span><span class="tx">point
number, which will then also be written on the sample packaging.
&nbsp;Along the SE wall, the </span><span class="tx">layer of
hard-packed smooth soil below 352 ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_352]) is
overexcavated, resulting in an artificial depression </span><span
class="tx">which should be ignored in the total station topo map of the
floor. &nbsp;There is an articulated brown-glazed juglet in pieces
through the collapse; total station point for the small find is taken on
the two largest pieces. &nbsp;Preparation is made for the sample pieces
of wood to be lifted. </span>

<span class="tx">In the church, Renata H. begins to excavate&nbsp;<span
class="tx f714">–</span>&nbsp;but before she can get to the tomb, she
starts to unearth the bodies belonging to two small skulls visible in
the upper level of the soil of the church. &nbsp;The area in which these
bodies are buried, although it lacks clear limits (the church in general
was disturbed by a modern bomb), is defined as Grave 1 (to distinguish
it from the built tombs 1 and 2). &nbsp;The skeletons are a child of ca.
4 yrs (#1) and a fetus or neonate (#2). </span>]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<span
class="tx">In room 31, where what appears to be a surface level has been
reached in the rectangular area the </span><span class="tx">room was
originally thought to occupy, two things become clear. &nbsp;One is the
base of a staircase, </span><span class="tx">apparently ascending to the
SE. &nbsp;The other is the fact that there is no wall after the N corner
of </span><span class="tx">room 30. &nbsp;As a result, we decide to
continue to remove the </span> <em><span class="tx f9">[p. 25: small
sketch of hypothetical reconstruction of structural arrangements in room
28&nbsp;</span><span class="tx f718">–</span><span class="tx
f9">shed-roofed wooden structure over the basin, the rest of the room
unroofed]</span></em>

<em><span class="tx f9">[p. 26] </span></em>

<span class="tx">layer of collapse ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_359]) as it
extends to the NW of room 30. </span>

<span class="tx">The various layers of collapse in rooms 33, 35 and 36
continue to be cleaned; modern intrusions </span><span class="tx">appear
to have been completely removed&nbsp;</span><span class="tx
f9">[hah!]</span><span class="tx">. &nbsp;These layers of collapse
([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_374] and [ark_link cxt=CH04SR_373]) seem to be
slightly </span><span class="tx">different from room to room, and where
they are clearly separated by walls (eg.&nbsp;</span><span class="tx
f9">[between]</span><span class="tx">&nbsp;35&nbsp;</span><span
class="tx">and 36) they will be treated separately. &nbsp;The collapse
will be photographed and mapped </span><span class="tx">topographically,
but will not be drawn or individually digitized. </span>

<span class="tx">In room 28, the layer of burnt wood ([ark_link
cxt=CH04SR_352]) continues to be cleaned, with some larger pieces left
in situ </span><span class="tx">on piers for possible conservation.
&nbsp;Finds this morning included a gold teardrop-shaped earring
</span><span class="tx">or piece of jewelry. &nbsp;Part of the floor
seems to be paved, and given the fragility of the bedrock </span><span
class="tx">basin and the quantity of burnt wood (and small quantity of
tile), Sam and Larissa and I agree </span><span class="tx">that this
room may have been roofed only partially (see sketch opposite).
&nbsp;After the newly </span><span class="tx">cleaned areas (and new
beams) are photographed, the conservators arrive to begin the lifting
</span><span class="tx">process. </span>

<span class="tx">In room 36, what we thought to be a layer of intact
collapse is reassessed&nbsp;</span><span class="tx f714">–</span><span
class="tx">&nbsp;</span><span class="tx f714">now we’re convinced
</span><span class="tx f714">it’s modern fill, and we remove it down to
the layer of yellow soil <span class="tx">([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_373])
</span>already visible on the NE side </span><span class="tx">of the NE
wall of rm 32.</span>

<span class="tx">In room 31, in the area behind rm 30, soil shows signs
of modern disturbance. &nbsp;The remaining </span><span

collapse (SR369 ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_369]) )&nbsp;</span><span

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<span
class="tx">In room 36, what we interpret as modern fill or disturbance
continues to be removed&nbsp;</span><span class="tx f714">–</span><span
class="tx">&nbsp;some few </span><span class="tx">fragments of modern
glass and tile are present in the lower levels, so the identification
seems to </span><span class="tx">be correct. &nbsp;The soil remains soft
and friable, with frequent pebbles and land-snail shells. &nbsp;As far
</span><span class="tx">as we can tell, the modern intrusion fills the
entire room, up to the walls&nbsp;</span><span class="tx
f714">–</span><span class="tx">&nbsp;it has all been </span><span
class="tx">removed as PA001, though in retrospect perhaps it should have
been given its own number (it </span><span class="tx">turned out to be
both deeper and wider than we originally thought). &nbsp;From today,
bags will be </span><span class="tx f714">separated by room (so today’s
finds will be PA001 from&nbsp;</span><span class="tx">rm 36). &nbsp;All
of it seems to come down </span><span class="tx">onto the yellow sandy
soil ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_373]) identified during the excavation of 32.
</span>

<span class="tx">In room 28, the remains of SR352 ([ark_link
cxt=CH04SR_352]) are removed. </span><span class="tx">Under one of the
beam concentrations, there are </span><span class="tx">a large number of
small slag or iron fragments&nbsp;</span><span class="tx
f714">–</span><span class="tx">&nbsp;they seem to be associated with
those recorded </span><span class="tx">as small find 2201 ([ark_link
sfi=CH04SR_2201]).</span>

<span class="tx">In room 29, the soil left to form a section along the
NW wall is removed, context by context. </span>

<span class="tx">In the church, work continues on tomb 2. &nbsp;All
non-bone non-ceramic objects from the fill&nbsp;</span><span class="tx
f714">–&nbsp;</span><span class="tx">SR362 ([ark_link
cxt=CH04SR_362])&nbsp;</span><span class="tx f714">–</span><span
class="tx">&nbsp;will be recorded as special finds; today, this begins
with a nail. &nbsp;Note the exception to </span><span class="tx">our
standard recording conventions&nbsp;</span><span class="tx f9"><em>[the
same applies to glass fragments]</em>.</span>

<span class="tx">In room 30, SR369 ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_369]) is
drawn&nbsp;</span><span class="tx f714">–</span><span
class="tx">&nbsp;due to some confusion, part of it was slightly
excavated, so the W </span><span class="tx">and N ends will have to be
reconstructed. &nbsp;There is a roughly circular cut at the W end, about
</span><span class="tx">15cm in diameter; the bottom is especially
hard-packed and along its edge (and in its fill, not </span><span
class="tx">recorded at the&nbsp;</span><em><span class="tx
f9">[time]</span></em><span class="tx">&nbsp;of exc. but assigned SR370
([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_370]) after the fact) are fragments of wood,
</span><span class="tx">apparently not</span>

<span class="tx f9"><em>[p. 30]</em> </span> <span class="tx">5/7 cont.
</span><span class="tx">belonging to roots. &nbsp;It seems likely that
this cut (SR371 ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_371]) ) was a post-hole associated
with some </span><span class="tx">later (18</span><span
class="tx">th</span><span class="tx">-19</span><span
class="tx">th</span><span class="tx">&nbsp;c?) event, and that it began
further up in SR358 ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_358]) and was missed during
</span><span class="tx">excavation. &nbsp;The wood, in particular, seems
too well-preserved to be very old, but the </span><span
class="tx">compaction of the bottom surface is difficult to ignore.
&nbsp;It might also explain the presence of a </span><span
class="tx">modern hinge and hasp found in 358 ([ark_link
cxt=CH04SR_358]) in roughly that area during excavation a few days ago.
</span>

<span class="tx">In rm 36, what appears to be a modern nail is found
among the lower levels of the area we are </span><span
class="tx">interpreting as modern fill&nbsp;</span><span class="tx
f714">–</span><span class="tx">&nbsp;shot in as a nail and saved in a
nail bag.</span>

<span class="tx">In rm 31, excavation of SR359 ([ark_link
cxt=CH04SR_359]) NW of rm 30 continues&nbsp;</span><span class="tx
f714">–</span><span class="tx">&nbsp;consistent layer of loose dark
brown </span><span class="tx">soil with tile and large stones. &nbsp;The
SW wall of this room has appeared&nbsp;</span><span class="tx
f714">–</span><span class="tx">&nbsp;it is badly damaged and
</span><span class="tx">bowed to the NE. </span> <em><span class="tx

four loose pages had been lost, </span><span class="tx f9">crossed out

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<span
class="tx">The lowest layer of collapse (SR355 ([ark_link
cxt:CH04SR_355]) ) in rm 29 is removed; in the W corner is another
pithos </span><span class="tx">stand, and various sherds of the pithos
that stood in it are found. One is saved with the soil in it
</span><span class="tx">still intact, for potential residue analysis.
&nbsp;When the floor is clean, the remaining topographical </span><span
class="tx">points are taken and documentary photos done. </span>

<span class="tx">In room 31, a new wall emerges&nbsp;</span><span
class="tx f714">–</span><span class="tx">&nbsp;it runs from the middle
of the door in the NW wall of rm 30 </span><span class="tx f9">[later
determined to run from the corner of the door, though some projection
into the door]</span><span class="tx">&nbsp;to </span><span
class="tx">the wall along the NW boundary of the NW extension. &nbsp;It
is built in fairly careless masonry and </span><span class="tx">seems
clearly to be a later addition. &nbsp;The collapse ([ark_link
cxt=CH04SR_359]) covers it and descends on both sides to a </span><span
class="tx">deeper level; it still seems to be consistent, although in
the S corner of the space NW of room 30 </span><span class="tx">is loose
and very soft&nbsp;</span><span class="tx f714">–</span><span
class="tx">&nbsp;possibly soil disturbed by animal burrowing. </span>

<span class="tx">In room 30, Anton and Taras continue to excavate 369
([ark_link cxt:CH04SR_369]), removing it from a soft gray-brown
</span><span class="tx">layer, compact but friable, that probably
represents the abandonment of the room (SR378 ([ark_link
cxt:CH04SR_378]) ). &nbsp;In </span><span class="tx">this layer are
found a large number of crab remains, as well as some fish bones (in
2002 a large </span><span class="tx">quantity of fish bones were found
on this floor). &nbsp;Some of the crab remains are concentrated in an
</span><span class="tx">area just to the SW of the door, next to the
wall. &nbsp;The layer is partially excavated at the N end </span><span
class="tx">before it is properly photographed and leveled, but a partial
photo and levels to the S are taken. </span><span class="tx">The N end
is shallower and comes down onto an area of stones, including one large
round stone </span><span class="tx">clearly sitting on the floor.
</span>

<span class="tx">In room 36, the intrusion/pit in the center of
the</span>

<em><span class="tx f9">[p. 34] </span></em> <span class="tx">6/7 cont.
</span>

<span class="tx">room is cleaned and another attempt is made to sort out
the situation. &nbsp;The sandy yellow layer ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_373])
</span><span class="tx">still seems to be under the gray-green-brown
layer, but voids also appear between rocks in it, and </span><span
class="tx f714">boundaries are unclear. &nbsp;I’m hoping for intact
collapse –</span><span class="tx">&nbsp;perhaps yellow because of the
type of </span><span class="tx">soil used as mud mortar in the
walls&nbsp;</span><span class="tx f714">–</span><span
class="tx">&nbsp;but I fear that much of the area has been disturbed by
</span><span class="tx">modern activity. </span>

<span class="tx">The possibility of yellow mud mortar&nbsp;</span><span
class="tx f714">–</span><span class="tx">&nbsp;or at least yellow mud
pointing&nbsp;</span><span class="tx f714">–</span><span
class="tx">&nbsp;is confirmed today </span><span class="tx">during the
cleaning of the walls in room 28 in preparation for drawing. &nbsp;Sam
notices that in the S </span><span class="tx">corner, the soil between
the stones is of the same yellow clayey color and consistency, and he
</span><span class="tx">also notices that the gaps seem to be pointed
and surfaced with what seems essentially to be a </span><span
class="tx">mud plaster. &nbsp;This may explain both the color of the
collapse and the general absence of plaster </span><span class="tx">on
these walls. &nbsp;He and I both also note an area where the wall seems
to be missing, just to the </span><span class="tx">SE of the bedrock
basin. &nbsp;In the course of further investigation, Sam uncovers what
appears to be </span><span class="tx">a small hiding-place for
valuables&nbsp;</span><span class="tx f714">–</span><span
class="tx">&nbsp;a deep, slightly irregular hole cut back at a (W-NW)
angle </span><span class="tx">into the bedrock under the NW wall of the
room and filled with silty brown soil containing, </span><span
class="tx">among other things, a fragment of 12</span><span
class="tx">th</span><span class="tx">-13</span><span
class="tx">th</span><span class="tx">&nbsp;century Syrian blue-glazed
pot. &nbsp;The hole is empty </span><span class="tx">and the wall was
not built back up over it, so it seems likely that if anything was
hidden there, </span><span class="tx">the occupants removed it shortly
before </span> <em><span class="tx f9">[p. 35: sketch of the first layer
of full depositions in t. 2 in the church, with skeleton
numbers]</span></em>

<em><span class="tx f9">[p. 36] </span></em> <span class="tx">or at some
point after the abandonment of the room/building. &nbsp;The
stratigraphic relationships in&nbsp;</span><span class="tx">this corner
are unfortunately unclear, due to the overcutting mentioned earlier, but
the following </span><span class="tx">sequences may be proposed: </span>

<span class="tx">1)&nbsp;</span><span class="tx">the hole was opened and
filled in gradually, after which point the infant was buried,
</span><span class="tx">after which the room burned </span> <span
class="tx">2)&nbsp;</span><span class="tx">the room burned, then the
hole was opened and filled in gradually, and into the upper </span>
<span class="tx">layers of destruction that filled the
cut&nbsp;</span><span class="tx f9">[for the hole]&nbsp;</span><span
class="tx">the tomb of an infant was cut.</span>

<span class="tx">The first idea may be supported by the ash level
visible on the wall over the level of the infant </span><span
class="tx">burial; the second by the likelihood that the higher levels
of the infant grave were missed and by </span><span class="tx">the
apparent absence of ash or charcoal in most of the fill of the hole.
&nbsp;In addition, for the </span><span class="tx">medieval period, the
burial of a newborn child in an abandoned house right next to a
(possibly </span><span class="tx">abandoned) church seems more likely
than the burial of a newborn in a functioning </span><span
class="tx">stable/court/smithy. &nbsp;The children buried shallowly in
the floor of the church may represent the </span><span class="tx">same
period of activity. </span>

<span class="tx">In the church, work continues on t. 2. &nbsp;The
disarticulated bones at the NE end are removed to </span><span
class="tx">reveal 3 intact (more or less) depositions&nbsp;</span><span
class="tx f714">–</span><span class="tx">&nbsp;a fourth, belonging to a
child, has already been </span><span class="tx">removed. &nbsp;The
numeration of the skeletons, at least as it was assigned in the field,
is as in the </span><span class="tx">sketch on the facing
page.&nbsp;</span>

<em><span class="tx"><span class="tx f9">[p. 38] </span></span></em>

<span class="tx"> 6/7 cont.</span>

<span class="tx">In room 33, the remainder of SR337 ([ark_link
cxt:CH04SR_337]) is removed and the layer beneath cleaned. &nbsp;Between
the two Marina identifies and distinguishes a thin and irregular layer
of plaster fragments with a distinct concentration in the N corner of
the room (SR375 ([ark_link cxt:CH04SR_375]) ). &nbsp;It is unclear
whether the very fragmentary white plaster represented is modern or
medieval.</span>]]></content:encoded>

completely cleaned, photographed, georeference </span><span
class="tx">photographed, and topographically mapped (not necessarily an
important or intact layer, but </span><span class="tx">seems a good
subject for experimentation). &nbsp;Once done, it begins to be removed
from the NE </span><span class="tx">side. </span>

<span class="tx">In room 36, removal of the brown soil
continues&nbsp;</span><span class="tx f714">–</span><span
class="tx">&nbsp;it is decided to take out what appeared to be
</span><span class="tx">collapse over the SE wall but which now seems to
be further fill related to the </span><span
class="tx">pit/disturbance/crater (?) in the center of the room.
&nbsp;</span><span class="tx">There are currently three visible

today is the removal of the rest </span><span class="tx">of the brown.

<span class="tx">In room 35, the removal of compact dark brown collapse
SR374 ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_374]) begins. &nbsp;The stones in this room
</span><span class="tx">are smaller and the soil darker, though Dyma and
Sasha feel that the upper levels, at least, are </span><span

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<span
class="tx">In room 30, Anton cleans the floor ([ark_link
cxt=CH04SR_378]), including the areas exposed in 2002, and excavates the
</span><span class="tx">sediment and erosion material that collected in
the pit or depression along the SW wall </span><span
class="tx">(excavated partially, or at least identified in 2002).  See
sketch opposite for location of this and </span><span class="tx">other
pits in this layer.</span>

<span class="tx">In room 31a, rocky brown collapse SR359 ([ark_link
cxt=CH04SR_359]) is removed; it covers a soft layer of grayer, ashier
soil </span><span class="tx">with small to medium charcoal inclusions, a
piece of burnt wood, and a fairly large number of </span><span
class="tx">tiles ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_386]).  It is separated from its
counterpart SR390 ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_390]) by a very wide but poorly
built wall, preserved </span><span class="tx">only for a few courses and
dividing rm 31 into two just to the NE of the door in the NW wall of
</span><span class="tx">rm 30. </span>

<span class="tx">In room 35, the uppermost layer of rocky brown soil
(SR374 ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_374]) ) begins to be removed.  It seems,
</span><span class="tx">from the finds, to represent modern dumping, and
it may fill in some pits or depressions in the </span><span
class="tx">uneven surface of the layer of collapse (?) below.  Finds
include a spherical lead bullet of </span><span class="tx">Crimean War
date </span><em><span class="tx f9">[or possibly 18</span><span
class="tx f9">th</span><span class="tx f9"> century</span><span
class="tx f718">—</span><span class="tx f9">Russian bullet of a type
standard until after the </span><span class="tx f9">Crimean
War]</span></em><span class="tx">. </span>

<span class="tx">In room 36, the loose brown pebbly
soil </span><em><span class="tx f9">[SR372 ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_372])]
</span></em><span class="tx">along the </span> <em><span class="tx
f9">[p. 41: sketch of the situation in rooms 36 and 33, with the large
rocks in 33 postulated as an </span><span class="tx f9">extension of the
intrusion in 36; later determined that this situation was unlikely, and
the rocks </span><span class="tx f9">in room 33 probably in
situ]</span></em>

<em><span class="tx f9">[p. 42] </span></em> <span class="tx">NW wall of
the room begins to be removed.  It seems to sit on top of the yellow
soil with stones, </span><span class="tx">but its relationship to the
fill of the disturbance in the center of the room is
unclear </span><span class="tx f714">–</span><span class="tx"> they may
be </span><span class="tx">the same action, although when the pit was
cleared it seemed to have very visible and well-</span><span
class="tx">defined edges.  Below this brown (and slightly greenish) soil
is a layer of ashier, more compact </span><span class="tx">gray-green
soil similar to 341 ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_341]) in room 32 (and perhaps
equal to it, if it extends across the wall) </span><span class="tx
f9">[later determined to be the same fill as SR372 ([ark_link
cxt=CH04SR_372]) , above the yellow, and removed as such]</span><span
class="tx">.  The </span><span class="tx">relation of this layer to the
yellow layer is also unclear. </span>

<span class="tx">There is a similar situation in room 33, where the
final cleaning of SR375 ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_375]) reveals a
pinkish-red </span><span class="tx">soil with ash, burnt wood and tile
inclusions along both the SW and the NE sides of the room but
</span><span class="tx">what seems to be a thicker layer of brown soil
and large stones in the center of the room, more or </span><span
class="tx">less of the same width as the break in the NW wall of 33.  I
am starting to think that the </span><span class="tx">pit/disturbance in
rm 36 was much larger than we originally defined it, and that the same
action </span><span class="tx">was responsible for the disturbance of
rooms 33 and 36, as well as the destruction of the wall. </span><span
class="tx">Larisa disagrees </span><span class="tx f714">–</span><span
class="tx"> the discussion hinges on the presence or absence of yellow
soil over the </span><span class="tx">destroyed part of the wall.  I am
relatively certain that brown-green soil covered that area, while
</span><span class="tx">she remembers the presence of yellow soil.  Her
interpretation would make the yellow later than </span><span
class="tx">the destruction of the wall, mine </span><span class="tx
f9"><em>[potentially]</em> </span><span class="tx">earlier (see sketch
opposite) </span><em><span class="tx f9">[in any case, our final
</span><span class="tx f9">decision was that the yellow postdated the
destruction of the wall and that both it and the brown </span><span
class="tx f9">are likely to have been some sort of mixed
fill]</span></em><span class="tx">.</span>

<span class="tx f5">Room 28 receives a final cleaning.  The metalworking
hearth (SR391 ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_391]) ) is roughly circular, with a
</span><span class="tx f5">narrow trail of metal fragments leading away
to the N/NE, perhaps representing a flue or </span><span class="tx
f5">bellows-hole.  The surface of the floor seems to be </span>
<em><span class="tx">[p. 43: sketch plan of the floor of room 28; sketch
of the fifth and final layer of articulated </span><span
class="tx">depositions in t. 2 in the church] </span></em>

<em><span class="tx">[p. 44]</span></em>

burnt – or at least exposed to heat – near the door to the street, and
there are several large patches of charcoal on the floor in the E
quarter of the room (see sketch opposite). A bronze coin is recovered
from the fabric of the floor, but is probably Hellenistic or Roman;
other material recovered <em>[from the floor]</em> during cleaning
suggests a 13<sup>th</sup>-c. date for the floor. There is no sign of
the kiln or oven above the metalworking hearth. As the very bottoms of
the walls were cleaned, a number of fragments of charcoal and slag came
out, perhaps having been swept or kicked there during the occupation of
the room. The floor also seems to contain a number of very, very heavily
burnt animal bones – burnt almost to the point of vitrification.

The final layer of bones in t. 2 is photographed and removed. There are
three articulated skeletons, one of a child and two of infants/toddlers
(see sketch opposite). The bottom and lower sides of this grave are
formed by cut bedrock.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<span
class="tx">In room 31, the lowest layer of tile collapse ([ark_link
cxt=CH04SR_386]) is cleaned, revealing a relatively smooth layer that
</span><span class="tx">may represent either abandonment or a rough
floor level ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_405]).  After that is cleaned and
</span><span class="tx">photographed, the corresponding lower level of
collapse in room 31a is cleaned.  Since a large </span><span
class="tx">number of fish bones appear, and since the room seems to be
connected to activity in room 30, </span><span class="tx">we decided to
dry-sieve the soil in an effort to capture more evidence.</span>

<span class="tx">In room 30, Anton S. cleans and excavates the pit along
the SW wall of the room </span><span class="tx f714">–</span><span
class="tx"> the pit was </span><span class="tx">identified in 2002 but
not excavated, and its extent appears not to have been fully identified.
</span> <em><span class="tx f9">[p. 45: sketch plan, not to scale, of
SR373 ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_373]) in room 36 and SR401 in room 33]
</span></em>

<em><span class="tx f9">[p. 46] </span></em> <span class="tx">The fill
of this pit (SR383 ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_383]) ) also contains many fish
bones, as well as some relatively large </span><span class="tx">chunks
of charcoal or charred wood. </span>

<span class="tx">In room 35, work continues on the removal of SR374
([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_374]) .  Below it is what seems to be an intact
</span><span class="tx">layer of rocky collapse over most of the
room </span><span class="tx f714">–</span><span class="tx"> but against
the NE wall, there is a space of clean </span><span class="tx">soil with
very few rocks.  This soil may represent an intrusion, but its
relationship with the rocky </span><span class="tx">collapse is not yet
clear. </span>

<span class="tx">In room 36, the situation continues to be confusing.
 The brown green soil ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_372]) is removed, leaving
</span><span class="tx">large isolated outcrops of yellow soil
([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_373]); in the W corner, on the other hand, it
appears to come </span><span class="tx">down onto a layer of ashy
destruction </span><em><span class="tx f9">[later determined to be part
of the same brown-green-gray </span><span class="tx f9">layer mentioned
above, and demonstrated to cover the yellow soil]</span></em><span
class="tx">.  Work slows along the SW </span><span class="tx">wall,
since it needs to be propped up to prevent its collapse.  Along its base
the layer of tile, ash </span><span class="tx">and burnt wood seems to
continue.  Once the brown is largely removed, we also remove the
</span><span class="tx">lump of yellow in the S corner.  Despite the
color difference, it seems just as loose and disturbed </span><span
class="tx">as the brown.  Once it has been taken down to the level of
the bottom of the pit, Clay, Anton and </span><span class="tx">Andrei
begin to remove the yellow soil in the E corner.  Like that in the S
corner, it is extremely </span><span class="tx">loose and friable; but
unlike the other outcrop, it contains a large number of carefully worked
</span><span class="tx">architectural elements, some with plaster still
attached and nails stuck in them. </span>

<span class="tx">In room 33, the layer of fill/disturbance in the center
of the room is removed </span><span class="tx f714">–</span><span
class="tx"> although it was </span><span class="tx">initially designated
as SR376 ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_376]) to match the fill of the pit in
room 36, it is subsequently changed to </span><span class="tx">SR401
([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_401]) when the quantity of tiles, plaster and
charcoal seems to be much greater. </span> <em><span class="tx f9">[p.

<em><span class="tx">9/7 cont. </span></em>

<span class="tx">SR401 ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_401]) is removed; it covers
the center and W corner of the room.  Beneath it is a layer of yellow
</span><span class="tx">soil (similar to that in 36? But seems more
compact) in the W corner and a layer of reddish-</span><span
class="tx">brown to pinkish-buff soil with traces of burning in the rest
of the room (SR392 ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_392]) along the SW </span><span
class="tx">side, SR393 ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_393]) in the N corner).
 Cleaning along the W side of the NW wall reveals a large iron
</span><span class="tx">fixture or implement, apparently in situ
(photographed).  There also seem to be a number of large </span><span
class="tx">pithoi broken in situ in this room; whatever the disturbance
in the upper layer, it does not seem to </span><span class="tx">have
affected the integrity of the lower levels of collapse. </span>

<span class="tx">Anton and I consult about the boundaries of the pit
([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_389]) along the SW side of room 30; one side is
cut </span><span class="tx">into bedrock, but the other seems to take a
particularly thick layer of the floor as its limit, and it </span><span
class="tx">is difficult in places to distinguish soft fill from soft
lower levels of floor fill.  By the end, </span><span class="tx
f714">though, I’m confident that we have the correct limits.  While I’m
over there, I not</span><span class="tx">ice a fairly </span><span
class="tx">regular cavity cut into bedrock where the bedrock terrace
intersects the SE wall of room 30, </span><span class="tx">about 40-50cm
above the level of the floor.  In cleaning out this cavity or niche in
an attempt to </span><span class="tx">identify a possible drain from the
courtyard into the pit in room 30, I remove a very soft, very
</span><span class="tx">dark brown loamy fill with inclusions of decayed
bedrock, a few small pieces of ceramic, and no </span><span
class="tx">other finds except for two very large astragaloi, probably
from cattle, set side-by-side and level </span><span class="tx">and
wedged into the soil of the niche.  By position and arrangement they
seem very unlikely to </span><span class="tx">be simple food refuse (see
sketch opposite) </span><span class="tx f714">–</span><span
class="tx"> good luck charms associated with building? </span><em><span
class="tx f9">[with </span><span class="tx f9">reference to this, it
should be noted that in the early fill of the pit under the floor of
room 36 were </span><span class="tx f9">several similar astragaloi,
which I should interpret as food refuse were it not for the fact that at
</span><span class="tx f9">least one was worked on both sides to flatten
it </span><span class="tx f718">–</span><span class="tx
f9"> </span><span class="tx f718">I don’t know what the explanation for
this is]</span></em><span class="tx">. </span> <div class="tb

f5"><span class="tx">The day starts with much cleaning.  Room 30 is now
done and will await the excavation of the </span><span class="tx">floor.
 In room 31a, the layer of abandonment is removed to reveal a
hard-packed floor surface in </span><span class="tx">which appear two
large, flattish rocks, as well as half of a circular handmill.  The
level of the </span><span class="tx">floor here is lower than it is in
room 3, and is appropriate for the level of the doorsill.  In the W
</span><span class="tx">wing of room 31, a pile of collapse left outside
the N corner of 30 is removed and collapsing part </span><span

area </span><span class="tx f714">–</span><span class="tx"> either the

achieve some clarity.  In removing the modern fill in the doorway in

the floor.  The sequence seems to be 1) </span><span class="tx">some
sort of massive intrusion, 2) yellow fill, 3) brown fill, perhaps in
conjunction with a new </span><span class="tx">intrusion.  Newly
confident that the yellow is simply fill, we begin to remove it even
more </span><span class="tx">aggressively. </span></p> <p class="tb

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Room 30 is drawn.
An upper layer of collapse continues to be removed from the area of the
NW extension that borders courtyard 1; finds include a reused fragment
of Roman gravestone ([ark_link sfi=CH04SR_2358]).

In room 31 next to the stairs, Shawn identifies what seems to be an
upper floor surface of gravelly, soft but compact gray soil. It may be
related to the stairs, also a late construction; the use of space and
distribution of covered/uncovered space in that area is unclear, but one
might

<em>[p. 55: rough sketch indicating the location of SR416 ([ark_link
cxt=CH04SR_416]), the layer discussed above]</em>

<em>[p. 56]</em>

suggest the latest surface of a narrow uncovered passage providing
access to the area under the stairs rising from the alley to the SE.
(see sketch, opposite)

In room 35, the layer of rocky collapse continues to be removed and the
layer of burnt tile collapse below cleaned. The rise in level at the NE
end of the room appears to be due to a rise in bedrock, analogous to
that in rm 28.

Room 36 continues to make explanation difficult. The yellow and brown
fills continue to be removed – 372 ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_372]) is
uppermost and is taken off the yellow below. The yellow lies over a
clear layer of burnt material and black ash, but at the same time stones
and bedrock projecting from the lower part of the NE wall seem to
indicate that we have descended below the level of the original floor –
hacked out by whatever post-abandonment activity took place here?
<em>[later determined that the final floor was, in fact, at this level;
problems with walls still not satisfactorily explained as of 22/7]</em>
The burnt material contains fragments of broken pithoi, lying flat; it
may represent the base of the cut. Alternatively, there is some slight
chance that the line of stones under the NE wall represents an earlier
wall at a slightly different orientation – but this seems less likely.
All the brown &amp; yellow fill in this room seems, at this point, to
have been disturbed – though the almost total lack of dating material is
bothersome.

The layers of yellow-brown collapse with some large stones in the S
corner (SR392 ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_392])) and yellow-brown collapse of
a slightly drier and more friable consistency (SR393 ([ark_link
cxt=CH04SR_393])) continue to be removed in room 33. More pithoi appear,
broken in situ, as well as a number of articulated fragments of coarse
and fineware vessels (including a <em>[13<sup>th</sup> c.]</em>
polychrome-ware sherd <em>[from a jug]</em> with a siren or harpy). One
of the pithoi in the W corner seems to have burnt organic material and
insects in it – will be sampled when Galina Pashkevich comes.

<em>[p. 58]</em>

With Dana, I remove the soil from the hearth in rm 28. In doing so, I
identify two layers of burnt fill; one, the upper, somewhat looser and
with a much greater concentration of small pieces of slag; and the other
cleaner, more compact with charcoal inclusions and fewer pieces of slag.
Only the latter (SR415 ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_415])) exists across the
whole hearth. The former was partially removed when the conservators
removed a piece of intact wood. The hearth is sectioned roughly along
that line during excavation, and the section photographed but not drawn.
All the soil from the hearth is kept in sample bags, separated according
to the two contexts; the largest pieces of slag and the results of
magnetic investigations (for hammer scale etc) are bagged separately and
taken by Dana to conservation.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[In the area of
yard 1 included in the NW extension, rubble and collapse/fill continue
to be removed, uncovering a new wall half-covered by the SW section wall
and what may be another new wall – albeit very strangely wide and very
poorly made – running between it and the SW wall of 31a/30 ([ark_link
cxt=CH04SR_31]). There also seems to be a new layer under collapse to
the N of the new SW-NE wall: a more compact gray layer with fewer
stones, at a higher level than the surface of the courtyard.

In room 34/yard 2, the fill of the cistern (?) near the N corner of the
2002 trench is excavated – the second layer of fill is a greenish brown
soil with some rocks and varying compaction, perhaps as the result of
animal turbation (there seems to be at least one burrow). This soil
covers a hardpacked tan soil along the N side that seems to be some

<em>[p. 59: rough diagram of the burned areas visible on the inside of
the pithos sherds from the vessel broken in situ in room
35]</em><em>&nbsp;</em>

<em>[p. 60]</em>

sort of deliberate step or platform. The green-brown soil contains many
animal and fish bones and a partially intact flat-bottomed coarseware
jug.

In room 35, Dyma and Sasha and Ira continue to clean off a layer of
broken, burnt pithos fragments and burnt wood. The layer has a slightly
confusing relation to the gray, smooth compact soil rising to the NE end
of the trench; the edge of the gray soil seems to cover it, but Dyma is
certain that the true edge of the gray is slightly further back and that
burnt material covers the gray instead. It is interesting to note that
the fragments of the pithos broken in situ were burnt in the position in
which they now lie – not only are most burnt only on their upper exposed
surface, but at least one shows a reserved space where another sherd lay
and protected it from burning (see sketch, opposite). The pithos, then,
had already been smashed or broken when the room burned – smashed by
invaders or broken after abandonment?

In room 36, no further clarity. The removal of the last of the yellow
reveals a relatively level expanse of burnt wood and tile broken into
small fragments in a matrix of slightly more compact yellow soil,
somewhat similar to the soil between the sherds and tiles of the intact
collapse in the rooms to either side. The area of broken tile, in fact,
looks very similar to those areas, down to the inclusion of carbonized
wood. But a number of questions remain, including the fate of the
original floor level – it would be strange if it did not initially
coincide with the level of the sills, and the way some of the burnt wood
slopes down from the sides also argues against floor.

<em>[p. 62]</em>

Furthermore, the patch of soft brown soil left against the SE wall, when
removed, produces a large quantity of animal bones and two articulated
glazed jugs that appear to have been broken and redeposited, not crushed
in situ.

In room 33, the remaining parts of 393 ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_393]) are
removed, revealing more pithoi broken in situ and an amphora in the same
state. There are also more fineware fragments and the base of a glass
lamp ([ark_link sfi=CH04SR_2401]) of the sort that would have been
placed in a hanging bronze chandelier.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[There is a
georeferencing and total station bottleneck this morning – 35, 36 and 33
have all arrived at layers that need georef photos and/or topographic
survey. Much standing around; in the meantime, the road continues to be
cleared, with the uppermost layer of large rocks (SR423 ([ark_link
cxt=CH04SR_423])) removed across most of the area of the stenopos (with
the exception of the E corner, where the deposit is left so as not to
dirty the layer in rm 33).

In rm 34/yard 2, Genja and Misha continue to excavate the cistern (?)
near the street. They reach a new layer about 1.25m down – a more
compact, slightly greasier grayish-brown soil (SR427 ([ark_link
cxt=CH04SR_427])). We also attempt to make arrangements with the
conservators to shore up the wall above, which is in a somewhat
precarious condition.

After photos are taken in 35, excavation continues, with some debate.
Dyma, Sasha and Ira feel that the smooth gray-brown layer that slopes
from the NE is a floor interface and perhaps earlier than the collapse;
their opinion is supported by the fact that the deposit of pottery and
tile ends more or less along the edge they established for the layer in
question. On the other hand, dark brown to

<em>[p. 63: sketch with dimensions and profile of intact green-glaze
juglet from room 36; sketch with dimensions of iron/bronze cross,
perhaps a reliquary cross, from room 35]</em>

<em>[p. 64]</em>

black burnt soil continues under that edge, quite clearly, and I think
that it represents the same layer of burning. The burning is thus likely
to be earlier than the gray deposit, as I see it. Difficulties arise in
the absence of burning between the rising bedrock along the SE wall and
the gray layer, but an analogous situation was present in room 28 –
perhaps the burnt material washed/eroded more thoroughly from the
exposed rock.

In room 36, after the completion of photos, Clay et al. turn to the
removal of the remains of the brown-green soil, to be followed by the
remains of the yellow soil – this should leave a unitary layer of burnt
wood and ashy black-gray soil across the area of the room. The question
of floor level has still not been resolved. Finds include and intact
(chipped rim but one section of profile complete) green-glazed juglet
(see sketch opposite) ([ark_link sfi=CH04SR_2416]).

In the area of yard 1 included in the NW extension, Roman and Stas
continue to descend, while in the area to the NW of the large, rough
wall (?), Shawn, Lena and Alla draw a layer of tile and ceramic collapse
(SR426 ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_426])) that appears to sit on top of a
floor or use surface (flat, smooth compact grayish surface). The
connection between this surface and the surface of the courtyard, which
should be lower, is not yet clear.

From room 35, from unsystematic sieving, comes a bronze cross pendant of
a sort that apparently functions as a reliquary locket (see sketch
opposite).

Steve arrives to lift a series of iron special finds in rm 35 and a
particularly well-preserved piece of burnt wood in rm 36. Cleaning of
the lower levels reveals burnt material

<em>[p. 65: sketch of situation in room 37 as of the 16<sup>th</sup> of
July, with pit and wide wall depicted, not to scale]</em>

<em>[p. 66]</em>

<em>&nbsp;</em>and tiles that seem increasingly like original
destruction. Sam, playing devil’s advocate, argues that all the collapse
above could have been original, but I don’t know how one could explain
either the voids between stones or the looseness of the soil in that
case. The question of the bottom of the intrusion, however, remains
troublesome – how and why could the lower deposit – the burnt wood in
particular – have been left in situ?

I notice a piece of glazed pottery behind clay pointing in wall 281
([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_281]), but Larisa dates it to the 10<sup>th</sup>
c, so probably residual. Another sherd in the same wall seems to belong
to an amphora with thick white slip, which Larisa attributes to the
13<sup>th</sup> c – but it is too deep in the wall to remove, so not
certain.

The pit in room 34 is completed; I assign a new number to the bedrock
cut, since only the uppermost layer of fill was excavated in
2002.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[The NW area of the
courtyard starts to become clearer: there is a closing wall, possibly
original, at the end of the 2002 trench, followed by a space including
the wide wall or construction and a massive pit, the preliminary limits
of which look as in sketch opposite. The relationship between pit &amp;
wall is not yet clear. On the other side of the large construction is
the area of broken tile and ceramics, which in turn covers a gravelly
gray-brown hardpack which seems to be cut by the pit (and perhaps by the
foundation of the wall). This hardpack is 10-20cm above the current
level of the courtyard, so <em>[it is] </em>difficult to tell if it is a
surface (separated from by the wall the 2002 section) or

<em>[p. 67: sketch of piece of worked and joined wood in situ in room
36, not to scale]</em>

<em>[p. 68]</em>

a compact layer of abandonment.

Excavation finished yesterday on pit in room 34 – bottoms about 1.5m
down on bedrock, with what may be a small settling pit. Unlined –
perhaps a soak-away pit for gray water produced by activity in alley
(but when filled?).

In room 35, gray compact soil continues to be removed – but possibly
overcut in E corner of room, where it is removed almost down to bedrock.
In the center of the NE side of the room, I try to keep excavation
limited to the gray soil itself (actually more yellow-brown gray in
areas where slightly more moist); it seems to cover a layer of darker,
ashier soil over the bedrock (remains of the layer of burning more
visibly present in the SW side of the room?).

In room 36, what is almost certainly an intact layer of destruction,
including much burnt wood, is cleaned for documentation. As in other
rooms, this seems to lie over a thin clay surface which lies in turn
directly on bedrock <em>[NB: this proved to be true for certain parts of
this room, but other parts lay over a series of thin layers or over
thick fills of pits and/or depressions in very irregular bedrock]</em>.
The projecting stones in the NE wall base, I’m now convinced, do
represent some earlier wall, rather than the level of a preexisting
floor above the current layer of destruction. It is still not clear what
the situation in this room was, but it does seem clear that at the time
of destruction the floor level was as low as it is now.

Excavation of SR410 ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_410]), the layer of
destruction above the floor of room 33, begins from the area of the door
to room 28. This part of the room, along the SW side, is very heavily
burnt, and the melting and revitrification of the glaze of the glazed
pottery in this area indicates that the fire reached very high
temperatures. This is the same area that showed a concentration of nails
in the layer

<em>[p. 69: sketch of burnt plank in rm 36, near door to 32, and sketch
of its possible position in a wooden door set under an arched
doorway]</em><em>&nbsp;</em>

<em>[p. 70]</em>

above, and this morning it produces a series of objects associated with
doors – a hasp ([ark_link sfi=CH04SR_2446], [ark_link sfi=CH04SR_2447]),
a number of keys ([ark_link sfi=CH04SR_2433], [ark_link
sfi=CH04SR_2443], [ark_link sfi=CH04SR_2448])&nbsp;<em>[some of these
later tentatively identified not as keys but as metal fixtures, perhaps
for a box or piece of wooden furniture]</em>. Marina is trying to leave
the broken vessels in situ for the photograph, so several of them stand
on <em>[low]</em> pedestals. Below 410 ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_410]) is a
very thin layer of fine black ash, to be associated with the fire in
this area; it is given a separate number, although in practice it proves
almost impossible to leave it in situ while removing 410 ([ark_link
cxt=CH04SR_410]).

Work also continues in the stenopos, where a layer of tile collapse
covering large portions of the street is cleaned, as are the walls of
the NE side of the insula.

The excavation of SR410 ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_410]) produces a large
stone with traces of burning and, stuck to its sides, a quantity of
burnt grain, perhaps barley or emmer wheat <em>[though similar grain
from other parts of this room has been identified as triticum aestivum,
naked bread what]</em>. The grain is too fragile to remove, so the whole
stone is saved as a sample ([ark_link smp=CH04SR_3]). Subsequent
excavation shows that this stone rested on top of a concentration of
burnt wood somewhat different from the planks and beams found in other
areas of burnt collapse (thicker, more knurled), and in the center of
this concentration is a pile of the same burnt barley/grain. Could this
have been a wooden bucket or bin? A sample of the grain is taken
([ark_link smp=CH04SR_5]) (and other samples are being taken randomly
for flotation).]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Before work this
morning it occurs to me that the piece of burnt wood in rm 36 with the
curved end is very likely to be a slat from a door meant to fit under an
arched lintel, which, from the number of voussoir blocks in the fill,
seems to be a standard method of door capping (see sketch opposite).

<em>[p. 72]</em>

In the NW end of yard 1 <em>[now technically room 37, since fully
separated from the court by the wall along the line of the 2002
section]</em>, work continues on the enormous pit. Fill is still soft
and brown with many bones and sherds from both coarse and fineware pots.
Alla and Lena go to clean the church in preparation for the arrival of a
local TV crew.

In room 35, excavation of hard-packed gray ashy fill (lower level)
continues along the NE side of the trench. The raised bedrock seems to
contain two circular hollows, probably pithos holes; one has a small
amount of broken pottery in it. The other seems to have been empty at
the time the gray layer was deposited. The layer of collapse on the
floor also begins to be removed; early small finds include an iron lock
<em>[?]</em> lying in situ near the door. A small patch of broken tiles
and pottery in the E pithos stand is being removed: after a moment of
slight confusion, it is given its own context number (yesterday’s photo
will have to be corrected in the register and database <em>[corrected in
database, not changed in register]</em>).

In room 36, the burnt layer is removed from a clean, smooth
chocolate-brown floor with a few large rocks apparently in situ along
the NW wall. Several large pieces of wood are pedestalled for
conservation. Brief discussion of a dog turd from <em>[under]</em> the
burnt layer – presumably left there yesterday by one of the site dogs.

Room 33 continues to be cleaned, leaving collapsed vessels intact. More
keys and iron objects emerge.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[The room delimited
by the NW wall of the courtyard is assigned a new number – rm 37. NB:
this number had previously been assigned to the room at the N corner of
the excavated area, but since it remains largely

<em>[p. 73: sketch plan of bedrock cuts in the NE end of room 35; sketch
plan of bedrock cuts in room 36 – neither to scale]</em>

<em>[p. 74]</em>

<em>&nbsp;</em>unexcavated and has produced no material, it seemed
easier to change that than to change several days’ worth of pottery bags
etc. In new rm 37, Shawn, Lena, Alla, Stas &amp; Roman remove the wide,
poorly constructed late wall that covers the large pit. The soil between
the stones of this wall seems very similar to the soil of the fill of
the pit; a relatively flat spread of broken tiles within this layer,
immediately under the lower of the two courses of the wall, may
represent an attempt to level the top of the fill of the pit (or the
foundation of the wall) at the moment of construction.

In room 35, the removal of the burnt deposit immediately over the floor
continues. At least one of the smashed pithoi seems to be in situ
between the propping stones serving as a stand. The bedrock cavities at
the NE end of the room reveal very little, though there is a fairly
clear small posthole cut between them (see sketch opposite).

In room 36, the floor continues to be cleaned. There seem to be several
postholes in this floor, in addition to the series of large irregular
stones that may have served as footings for posts or furniture. While
the latter are clearly in phase with the final use of the room, it is
not obvious that the postholes are – they may also be the remains of
earlier structures, which would support the idea that the angled
wall/bedrock cut along the NE side of the room belongs to an earlier
phase of construction. (see sketch opposite)

In room 33, removal of the lowest layer of destruction continues, still
attempting to leave pithoi in place.

The fill of the pit in room 37 (SR431 ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_431])) seems
to extend

<em>[p. 76]</em>

throughout the pit under the level of the wall, so when the wall has
been removed the remaining material is designated by the same number as
the fill removed on Friday-Saturday. There are a number of
well-preserved finds, including a bone tool handle, a bone knife handle
with the tang and part of the iron blade still in it, and several
nearly-intact vessels. There are also two pieces of glass and a piece of
pottery that strikes me as later than the 13<sup>th</sup> century –
perhaps even 15<sup>th</sup> <em>[though this is based only on
impression, not on any expert knowledge whatsoever]</em>. Larisa feels
that they could be intrusions into the layer, but I suspect they
represent the date of the fill of the pit and the construction of the
wall.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[The pit in rm 37
continues to be cleaned; the situation with the stone surface below is
no clearer, but after discussion with Stas, Larisa and myself, the
options seem to be the following: <ul> <li>the stones are extremely
large pavers for a monumental Roman-pd public square or forum
(Larisa)</li> <li>the stones are the foundation layer for a monumental
structure or, better, a city wall (Stas)</li> <li>the stones are
actually bedrock in the process of being quarried &amp; then abandoned
(me)</li> </ul> I see the problems with the last – not least the
thickness of the seams and the cuts back over a surface, rather than
only against a face – but the other two seem difficult to accept given
the enormous size of the central stone (limits not visible, but at least
1.9m x 1.2m, 10-15cm thick <em>[these dimensions were by eye, not by
measurement – see next day’s notes for accurate measurements]</em>).
Once the pit is photographed, its walls are cleaned for section drawings
by Pyotr.

<em>[p. 78]</em>

Work finishes in rm 35; the remaining floor material is sampled. Dyma
and Sasha move back to rm 29, where the floor is sectioned along a SW-NE
line about 1.5m from the NW wall. Under the current floor (SR364
([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_364])) is a second floor layer – this layer, on a
preliminary basis, seems to include a hearth and a posthole against the
NE wall. For flotation sampling purposes, for every three buckets of
earth removed one bag of earth is saved.

In room 36, the last of the collapse material left to hold up wall btw
36 &amp; 32 is removed and room is swept again in preparation for
excavation of the floor. The excavation of the floor begins with the
removal of the thin, patchy layer of chocolate brown soil mainly located
along the NW side of the room &amp; in the corners (SR435 ([ark_link
cxt=CH04SR_435])).

In room 33, excavation of the layers of destruction immediately above
the floor continues. This morning the GIS people inform us that there
has been a significant confusion of small-find numbers over the last few
days – perhaps 15 numbers where wrong number assigned, number
duplicated, not mapped etc. About 7 of these cannot be reconnected with
spatial data; the bulk seem to be in rm 33, so the record of the large
number of iron objects produced by that trench in the last two or three
days will be imperfect. Similar but less widespread problems also seem
to affect the large quantity of architectural fragments from rm 36.

A trench stretching to the NE from the E corner of the NE extension (1m
wide, 2.7m from the trench wall) is opened in an effort to capture the
corner of the wall across the stenopos to the NE of our building. It
seems to be an area composed almost entirely of modern fill.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Richard
(Posamentir) came by last night to look at the stone feature; he thinks
it’s the slab cover of a monumental tomb. Larisa and I visited the forum
or temenos at the end of the main street today, however, and measured
some of the (Hellenistic? Roman?) pavers there – our largest slab is
larger, but as it appears now, not substantially so, and a pavement
cannot thus be ruled out <em>[actual measurements of slab as it appears
in the pit: width 1.17m, minimum length 1.72m, minimum thickness 16.5cm;
measurements of one of the largest slabs in the paving of the forum at
the end of the main street: width 1.04m, length 1.63m, thickness as much
as 20cm]</em>.

The extension of the NE extension over the road (see sketch opposite)
produces a stone that looks, potentially, like a corner block. It is
located about 2.7m from the face of our insula. Once this is uncovered,
we reduce the width of this trench and extend its length to the NW – the
new <em>[dimensions are] </em> 3.5m <u>from the insula wall</u> and 4.8m
from the <em>[SE] </em>edge of the initial extension.

In the area of room 30, the NW edge of the section is brought out the
same 40cm that was added to the section edge in rm 31a to capture the
other side of the wall <em>[of that room]</em>.

In room 29, the stratigraphic situation becomes more complicated. As I
understand it, the floor covers not only another floor but an
intermediary zone of loose brown soil between the two, as well as the
fill of a large circular hole cut in bedrock under the NE wall (see
sketch opposite). It also covers bedrock directly in the E corner (if it
is certain that no underlying layers are being removed). Some of the
fill of the posthole may have been removed without a new layer # and its
finds consigned to the floor (SR364 ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR364])); the
same is true of the leading edge of the looser brown layer. In fact, the
second floor forms a rather irregular T-shape, with the vertical bar
oriented toward the door, and another cut appears in the W corner of the
trench (a coin was found in it). Not clear if situation w/missing floor
is due in small part to overcutting, though the excavators are sure that
the limits are real.

<em>[p. 82]</em>

Excavation of the floor in room 32 also begins – the room is
half-sectioned arbitrarily and excavated on the NW side (the side
closest to rm 29). The first layer below the gray compact surface is a
dark gray ashy surface, about 2cm below floor level.

Room 33 is cleaned as far as it can be before the removal of the pithoi
and amphorae (which have all been given numbers and sampled – that is,
the ones with organic remains). Photographed and
georeferenced.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[No notebook
writing until the end of the day – very busy, meeting with Galina N.
about Bez, etc. – so some recreation <em>[that is, of excavation
circumstances]</em>. The most exciting developments take place in the
street, during the removal of the layer of tile collapse. These
developments are three: 1) the marble stones serving as a bench at the
corner of the main street and the stenopos turn out to be Early Byz
capitals from a church ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_486]); 2) towards the S end
of the street, in the center, there are a series of large paving stones
in a straight line – most likely covers for a box-drain ([ark_link
cxt=CH04SR_489]); and 3) about 2m to the NW of the door to room 36,
under the tiles in an area of ash but without a recognizable grave cut,
is a skeleton ([ark_link sph=CH04SR_293]) identified by Renata as that
of an older woman, lacking its head. Elsewhere the street is a fairly
regular pebbled surface, running down to the center with packed-earth
sidewalks along the sides.

<em>[p. 87: small sketch of iron tool found lying on the surface of the
courtyard]</em>

<em>[p. 88]</em>

In room 33, remains of articulated vessels continue to be removed &amp;
floor cleaned. Under pithos 1 is the bottom of a wooden bucket –
circular flat piece of wood with raised edges ([ark_link
sfi=CH04SR_2699]). It is not clear if several cyclindrical pieces of
wood in this area related to this object, nor whether some strange hard
organic material beneath it (leather?) is. The conservators attempt a
rubber impression and a block lift. They also block-lift a couple of
iron tools in another part of the room – one has short teeth that look
saw-like, but seems to have a central haft leading down to a handle
attached at an angle, so perhaps some sort of carding comb? See sketch
opposite.

In room 36, remains of bedrock fill removed. Pattern of cuts and holes
is unclear in both formation process (natural rock? Cuts?) and
arrangement – some aspects suggest cuts &amp; posts for earlier
structures, but not certain.

In room 32, remaining floor in excavated half-section is also removed to
bedrock, revealing a similar situation with cuts and pits, also a lot of
unclear use and function. Many are quite deep and filled at the bottom
with a layer of decayed bedrock mixed with ceramics and bone.

In room 29, the layer of packing under the third floor is removed down
to bedrock. The stratigraphy is still rather complex, with all three
floors and packing existing only in a narrow strip extending from the
doorway. The section of the floor is photographed and total station
points are taken on top and bottom, but it is not drawn for reasons of
time.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Work continues in
the extension of the trench into the road <em>[perhaps “street” is
better, to distinguish this from the main road – this is the
terminological distinction that has been drawn in the database etc]</em>
– there still seems to be a significant quantity of disturbed material,
and we have not yet been able to figure out where the line of the wall
of the next block is located (or continues from the possible corner
block). The tile collapse, where it is intact, seems to slope rather
steeply down to the E corner.

In room 36, the brown floor surface below a layer of black ash (which in
turn was below the grayish surface under the uppermost brown surface –
ash is 449 ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_449]), grayish was 448 ([ark_link
cxt=CH04SR_448]), lowest brown is 458 ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_458]))
begins to be removed in the W corner. Bedrock is exposed over most of
the room – although it is clear that it has been cut down near the
walls, the central part of the room is full of pits and fissures, and it
is not clear whether it was original untreated bedrock or whether it had
been cut. In thinking about the upper story of this house, both Larisa
and I agree that 36 is likely to have had an upper story; the situation
is less clear with the other rooms, especially those with intact roof
collapse, which one would assume to have fallen from a single story.
This may mean that the yellow &amp; brown soil in this room <u>was</u>
original, and of a different character b/c from an upper story. This
would

<em>[p. 83: axionometric sketches and sections of two possible
reconstructions of the upper floor of this complex of rooms; sketch of
the location of the two postholes found in the first surface under the
uppermost floor of room 32]</em>

<em>&nbsp;</em><em>[p. 84]</em>

explain, to a certain extent, the presence of the nicer architectural
fragments &amp; plastered material in the collapse – from the piano
nobile? See possible reconstruction ideas opposite.

The direction of the wooden upper stair is confirmed as we excavate the
floor of rm 32. Below the hardpacked last surface (even abandonment? Or
post-burning use?) is a darker, charcoal-rich layer that has a fair
amount of hammerscale <em>[in contrast to the layer above, which
produced almost nothing when examined with a magnet]</em>. Cut into that
layer are two oblong postholes along the outside line of the riser of
the highest step of the stone stair, along the line an upper flight
would have followed to a door in the NE wall, to an upper room. The soil
is also darker and harder-packed along this line, suggesting that it
might have a) been subject to more consistent traffic and b) protected
from the weather a bit more than the rest of the room. Below the black
metal-rich later, cut by the postholes in the wall, is a layer of loamy
dark-brown fill with many sherds, bones etc <em>[NB: the bedrock in this
area seems to erode very easily and form crusts as it does so, so that
areas that appear to be bedrock have consistently been found to contain
pottery, nails etc; in particular, in the area of the door between 32
and 36, a thick crust of bedrock appeared to have eroded down from the
door, or perhaps to have been worn down and spread by human
traffic]</em>.

Pithoi and amphorae continue to be removed in rm 33 (see [ark_link
cxt=CH04SR_456]). The bottom of one of the best amphorae is saved with
soil intact for possible residue analysis ([ark_link smp=CH04SR_71]).
More iron objects emerge from the W corner. Under one of the pithoi on
the NW side of the room is another pile of burnt grain, this time with
linear fibrous structures that could be straw or chaff (photo’d, sample
taken ([ark_link smp=CH04SR_67])).

In room 29, excavation of the floor on the SE side of the room
continues. Now there seem to be at least 3 floor surfaces sitting above
a layer of hard-packed soil leading in a NW-SE line running roughly from
the door. This may represent fill simply packed down by the passage of
people into and out of the room along this line.

Late in the day, a series of flat marble blocks along the

<em>[p. 85: sketch of gameboard/graffito on the southernmost of the
column capitals used as a bench outside the E corner of the insula;
small sketch of the possible profile of the street]</em>

<em>[p. 86]</em>

corner of rm 33, street side, are cleaned off – the discovery of incised
gameboards (?) on one of them makes us think that they probably served
as a low bench outside the house (see [ark_link cxt=CH04SR_486]). The
road trench continues to refuse to provide a wall, although the road
itself is visible as gaps in the collapse. A concentration of large
stones and what appears to be a dip in the layer along the NE wall of
this trench suggests that the building material of the wall of the block
NE of ours has been removed <em>[further excavation suggests instead
that the wall is simply located another 50cm or so beyond the limit of
our excavation]</em>.

There is a pit in the W corner of rm 36 – it is filled with a soft, dark
brown soil with white streaks that forms small clumps, is relatively
moist, and contains very large amounts of animal bone and broken pottery
(heavily 9<sup>th</sup>-10<sup>th</sup> c). It has not been bottomed by
the end of the day, although at the SW end there appears to be a step or
shallower area.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[The remaining bit
of uncleaned road is cleaned and photographed; the drain is discovered
to turn the corner <em>[to the E and down] </em>into the main street,
but it becomes clear that we have not,

<em>[p. 90]</em>

in fact, captured the outside wall of the next insula. I suspect it is
ca. 50cm to the NE. The bench is given a context number as a wall
([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_486]), but each architectural fragment will also
be removed and catalogued as a small find.

The conservators continue to remove burnt wood in the W corner of rm 33,
where this morning they find pieces of a wicker or reed basket and what
seems to be a piece of preserved unburnt wood. This corner is occupied
by a series of stones ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_487]) that seem to form the
base for various containers, including pithos 1 &amp; the bucket/barrel
(and perhaps the basket as well). The stones (SR487 [ark_link
cxt=CH04SR_487]) are georeferenced, photographed, and removed to
facilitate the lifting of the wood.

Work continues in rm 32, where the filling in the bedrock has been
almost entirely removed. What is left is a series of deep,
subrectangular cuts with no obvious function and no apparent relation to
any of the features in rm 29 or rm 36.

The remaining floor levels in rm 29 are also removed; no particular
features on this side of the room, though a few shallow depressions may
represent other cuts.

By the end of the day, excavation is down to bedrock in the half-section
of room 32, in room 36, and in room 29. The floor of room 33 has been
cleaned to the last-phase level and will be left for further
investigation next year, along with the floors of rooms 28 and 32 (the
remaining floor of the latter). The road is cleaned along its entire
exposed length, with the exception of the area containing the skeleton,
which is covered with geotextile &amp; backfill.

The final events before the close of excavation are the removal of the
last remains of the mound of modern backfill that sat over the plateia
at the end of the trench

<em>[p. 92]</em>

and the initiation of cleaning activity in preparation for final photos.
At noon excavation is closed for the season.]]></content:encoded>

entry, third day of excavation. First two days occupied with meetings
and preparation of various sorts (tools, recording system, etc.). On
site, 28 June involves cleaning of grass and plant growth from all areas
of site; wet cool spring has led to large amount of vegetation, even in
conserved and gravel areas.

Second day (29 June) involved the laying out and excavation of two new
trenches/extensions. The first is a 1m wide test trench across the main
road ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_504]).]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Notebook taking
interrupted where previous entry leaves off. 1m wide test trench across
the main road ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_504]) is meant to test stratigraphy
in road in preparation for excavation all the way to the modern street
next to museum buildings. In the test trench, which runs off the E
corner of the 2004 trench to the other side of the main road
(projected), we find two layers of modern fill -- one gray, friable,
full of modern building debris (ark_link cxt=CH05SR_503]), the other
dark brown, loose, full of rocks and older material (but still some
modern) ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_504]) -- and beneath them what appears to
be an intact layer of collapse covering the <em>L[ate]
</em>B<em>[yzantine]</em> street surface ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_516]).
The latter may be contiguous with the layer of collapse ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_582]) in the street along the NE edge of the building (now
"East Stenopos").

In the East Stenopos, cleaning of topsoil began on 29 June. In the
northern area, topsoil covered a layer of gray modern fill ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_506]). Elsewhere, it seems to cover the LB collapse levels
directly. The one exception is in the area of the modern drainage trench
noted in 2001-2002; that intrusion is cleanly visible in the E Stenopos
as an interruption of collapse levels in both surface &amp; section
([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_581]).

In consultation w<em>[ith]</em> C Salter, thinking about metal-working
in rooms 28 &amp; 33 develops. CS feels that there is another hearth
slightly to the E of 418 ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_418]); he also notes a
piece of hearth floor ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_518]) remaining in 418,
which we will try to lift w<em>[ith the]</em> bedrock under it. In room
33, a patch of denser burning under, not over, the last floor surface
([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_451]) and a scatter of slag &amp; metal debris in
the E corner suggest to CS another hearth&nbsp; ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_508]). This would have been in operation earlier than the
storeroom function. In general, the waste CD has seen is from
small-scale working at low temperatures, more characteristic of e.g.
nail-making than welding or tool-repair.

We develop a sample strategy for floor of room 33: 500g samples
collected at points every 50cm across the room for 2m out from the NE
wall. Sample sites are flagged &amp; shot in while bags numbered, and
then appropriate bags used for sample taken around each

<em>[p. 3]</em><em>&nbsp;</em>

point. When this work is completed, floor of rm 33 will be excavated.

NB: In dealing w<em>[ith]</em> same layers across different years, same
procedure as last year followed: layer code will be CH05 followed by
same number as last year; new context sheet w<em>[ith]</em> reference to
old -- plus any additional info -- will be generated; new database
record will be generated; and all finds etc. will be bagged
w<em>[ith]</em> CH05 code.

We conduct a new georef<em>[erencing]</em> vs drawing at 1:50 accuracy
test in rm 38, after the collapse ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_512]) is
thoroughly cleaned. We will have Italo Giordano, who has a fair amount
of drafting experience but who is not a professional draftsperson, draw
approx. 1/3 of the collapse by hand, using triangulation from fixed
drawing pegs, at 1:50. The same area will then be photo'd &amp;
georeferenced &amp; digitized. Both resulting plans will be compared in
the GIS to survey points taken at a series of known and recognizable
spots. In this way we hope to compare the average experience of a site
where planning is done by hand to the georeferencing/digitization system
we have developed.

In the main road, levels of modern fill are removed, starting from the
edge of previous excavation in front of the block. The same
gray/building debris ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_503]) &amp; brown/rocks
([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_504]) superposition seems to apply.

In the NW end of the courtyard, we begin to excavate the large pile of
rocks left untouched in 2002. These rocks were originally thought to
cover another cistern, but excavation shows that they are in fact the
fill of a (modern?) pit ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_523]), perhaps to be
associated with the modern drainage ditch mentioned above. The cut has
relatively distinct edges, where the tan-gray compact clayey soil
underlying the court surface is visible. The fill is a relatively
consistent brownish, friable soil with large sandy clumps, frequent
land-snail shells, and very mixed material representing all periods of
activity in the area ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_507]). The top of a small
glass bottle with squared shoulder is probably modern and should date
the fill.]]></content:encoded>

modern fill in road -- apparent situation is two chronologically
distinct modern layers, one dating from the 19th c. &amp; monastery
activity ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_504]), the other from the destruction of
the monastery building in this area in the 20th century ([ark_link
cxt-CH05SR_503]). Although most material is not retained, we will try to
keep particularly diagnostic material to confirm or reject this idea.
<em>[arrow leads from here to paragraph beginning “also on main street”
below]</em>

The Stenopos collapse ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_423]) is documented with a
series of georeferencing photos. The 1m spread of reference points with
substantial overlap seems to be fairly accurate.

Drawing of room 38 reveals problems with the current plan alignment of
the NE wall -- needs to be rotated NE by about 5 degrees. Will be dealt
with by architect this afternoon; other potential base-plan problems
will be checked.

also on main street: upper layer of collapse ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_516])
is now being removed near the test trench; behind that team, another

<em>[p.4: sketch of plan of the mouth of the well at the N end of the
courtyard and section of the deposits filling it, not to scale]</em>

<em>[p.5]</em>

has begun to remove the lower layer of brown collapse ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_582]). In rm 33, metal sample of last floor is complete
([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_451]); that floor begins to be excavated down to
the black ashy layer below from the NE wall of the room ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_508]).

NB x2: 1) Some illicit digging/vandalism went on during lunch yesterday
in rm 33: a hole was dug at sample point in N corner and another
partially under the sill of the blocked door; 2) one or more of the
metallurgical samples in the area of the suspected hearth may have mixed
the floor layer &amp; the layer beneath &amp; may give false positive
(Chris aware of situation).

-- In rm 33, paleobotanical flotation samples collected at rough 1m
intervals in quincunx pattern <em>[parenthetical illustration of
pattern] </em>([ark_link smp=CH05SR_338]). Samples are approx. 1/2 size
of large bags (so 1/2 size of previous year).

At N end of courtyard, excavation in second pit continues ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_523]). Upper fill was large rocks; below were same rocks in
increasingly visible matrix of pebbly brown loose soil with root mold
(standard fill soil) ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_507]). Sides of pit are ca.
2m in diam<em>[eter]</em>. at top; about 35cm down there is a partial
floor into which a smaller extension of the pit continues; about 20-30cm
after the narrowing of the pit, it begins to be cut into bedrock (see
sketch opposite). Just below bedrock lip, fill starts to be softer &amp;
with fewer stones; will become new context ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_511]).

Courtyard is sectioned along line projected from outside edge of rm 25.
Brushed down once more in prep. for metallurgical sample
collection.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>[Passage
redacted]</em> First two days of week primarily occupied w<em>[ith]</em>
ongoing georeferencing photography of street and room 38 (in conjunction
with drawing vs georef experiment), with continued removal of modern
fill ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_504]) from street, and with extensive
metallurgical sampling of courtyard&nbsp; ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_509])
(first &amp; last involving a lot of time with total station, so fairly
slow). Work also continues, from Monday, on well at N end of courtyard
([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_511]) -- pulley and wooden work platform are set
up.

Today (Weds. morn<em>[ing]</em>) work in archaeological strata begins in
earnest. In main street, last of modern fill&nbsp; ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_504]) is cleaned from remains of ancient collapse, and
remaining corner of unexcavated fill on NE side of road test trench is
excavated to bring trench as a whole to square.

In room 33, Nick &amp; Olga finish cleaning, prepare to sample black
patchy layer in NE side (up to ca. 2m from NE wall of room) (([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_508]). They also take a sample from another ashy feature in
the S corner of room 33 ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_518]). When this sample is
complete, they will begin to sample the remaining floor in room 32 (the
upper layer of soil&nbsp; ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_354]) was removed
yesterday to reveal the ashy layer&nbsp; ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_460])
beneath) and excavate the potential second hearth in room 28 ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_505]).

In the courtyard, work continues on tomb 3 ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_514])
(cover slabs ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_513]) at W end and upper layer of
fill removed yesterday). Renata

<em>[p. 6: on upper part of page, sketch of bomb crater over part of
church and upper layers of tomb 3, with north arrow but not to scale; on
lower part of page, sketch of ashy patches in courtyard to SW of rooms
29 and 32]</em>

<em>[p.7]</em>

supervises as first pieces of disarticulated bone emerge. The
half-section of the courtyard ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_509]) &nbsp;to the N
of the tomb begins to be excavated in 10-15 cm passes after
paleobotanical samples taken. Faunal collection w<em>[ith]</em>
reexamination of loose <em>[soil] </em>in wheelbarrow.

Excavation of well at N end of courtyard continues; new layer of fill
with more rocks reached late yesterday, very sterile -- only a few finds
of apparently Roman pottery &amp; glassware ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_517])
. Now approaching 3m deep; sides of cut bedrock shaft slightly more
square than round.

Excavation begins in rm 38 -- removal of rocky collapse with patches of
smaller stones and small tile fragments (very broken) ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_512]). Special attention paid to areas along NE &amp; SW
walls, where stone alignment suggests buttressing or bench.

First deposition reached in T.3 ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_514]). Only lower
half of body uncovered in area originally defined as tomb, so effort
made to find head area -- built sides only extend to waist of first
deposition. Head of tomb seems only to be defined by cut in fill of
courtyard -- but nearby bomb damage to chapel may also have disturbed
tomb (see sketch opposite).

Well in N end of courtyard ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_523]) may be cistern
after all -- about 3m below floor cut opens up to sides. Fill seems to
be entirely of large rocks, w<em>[ith]</em> soil filtered down between
-- almost entirely sterile.

In courtyard trench, gray ashy surface soil comes down onto compact,
clayey yellow fill with many sherds, bones, etc. Probably original fill
of court to create surface level ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_538]).]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Cleaning of main
road &amp; area on NE side of test trench is completed. Anton S.'s team
moves to NW end of Stenopos &amp; begins to work SE removing rubble
collapse down to tile fall ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_423]). Current
supervisorial distribution: Shawn is running excavation in sectioned
area in courtyard; Italo is running excavation in room 38; Dyma in pit
in N end of courtyard; Anton in street; Nick in rooms 28 &amp; 33 &amp;
32. Gordana is keeping registers &amp; checking up on people.

In pit ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_523]), Dyma finds proximal end of femur;
also suspects layer change, but may be simply environmental conditions.
Previous layer had large quantities of burned material, mostly Roman;
this layer not as clearly burned.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Entry for
yesterday not completed -- will continue with yesterday's info.

-- In courtyard, surface cleaned ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_509]) -- dark
patches of charcoal too poorly defined, recleaning establishes limits.
They seem to fill cuts or depressions in the yellow pebbly surface below
the final floor of the courtyard&nbsp; ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_538]) --
one is very large &amp; oval (at W corner of Complex 3), the others are
smaller &amp; circular &lt;(see sketch opposite). Layer cleaned and
photographed in preparation for sampling. Tomb ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_514]) completed -- only 2 skeletons; tomb shallow, only cut
into clay about 25 cm down (explains use of cover slabs).

-- In rm 38, after some discussion, layer of rocky collapse ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_512]) just under surface is removed. Determined to be latest
erosion/collapse

<em>[p. 8: sketch of first layer of disarticulated bones in tomb 4, not
to scale]</em><em>&nbsp;</em>

<em>[p.9]</em>

eroded from walls w<em>[ith]</em> some modern glass (fallen between
stones?) &amp; land snails<strong>. </strong>Comes down onto more
compact lighter brown to grayish brown soil with rocks protruding,
including &lt;archaeological&gt; <em>[error for “architectural”]
</em>elements probably from room. Currently considered to be original
intact collapse; being cleaned for photo as of 8/7 morning. Walls of
room have series of odd buttresses/constructions; one in W corner
probably an internal staircase. Probable doorway to room to NW at N
corner -- complex extending to NW.

In room 28, Nick cleans second possible hearth ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_418]) in final floor surface -- filled w<em>[ith]</em> tile
&amp; bone, little slag or charcoal. Rough circle w<em>[ith]</em> oval
extending from it (possibly overcut, possibly for bellows) -- drawn,
photographed.

In room 32, ash surface below final surface sampled ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_460]).

----

following <em>[notes] </em>are from 8/7

Morning is rainy -- no work on site until 9 am +. Data entry stuff in
morning. When work resumes, it is as follows:

-- rm 38: cleaning of surface of presumed original collapse – <em>[there
was a] </em>little overexcavation, but generally revealing what appears
to be intact collapse ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_512]).

-- stenopos: Anton &amp; co. find buried modern electrical cable
([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_533]). Clearly parts of Stenopos have been
disturbed by modern activity -- but traces seem to tend not to be
visible on surface. All excavated as one unit -- so any discussion of
material from NW end of street should take into account contamination.

-- courtyard: black patches given numbers, sampled, drawing completed.
Begin to be removed ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_524]).

-- well/cistern ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_523]): Odd cutting observed in SE
wall of shaft, below area where chamber begins. Water channel?

-- tomb 3 area ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_515]): cleaning to SW reveals
second tomb (T. 4) extending from the head of tomb 3, partially damaged
by event that destroyed church wall. The alignment of stones suggests
that another tomb is parallel to it to the NW, perhaps sharing a
wall/side lining w<em>[ith]</em> tomb 4.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Saturday occupied
w<em>[ith]</em>out much change to general outline of work as above.

Continued cleaning of black patches in courtyard ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_524]); true section around tomb 4 laid out and cleaned
([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_528]); drawing in room 38; excavation of remains
of black ashy layer in 32 and underlying fill ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_461]) where bedrock not present; more limited excavation in
Stenopos attempting to follow line of modern trench ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_533]); ongoing excavation in well and at crossroads where
modern trench passes through ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_523]).

Monday morning: working clockwise from tomb area:

-- tomb 4&nbsp; ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_528]) &amp; remaining area of new
trench/section cleaned; stone covering begins to be removed, layer of
disarticulated bones very close to surface, just under stones. SE side
of tomb still not clear; still off double-wall situation on NW side
&lt;(see sketch opposite). Is inner “face” simply a well-aligned series
of cover stones?

-- In courtyard, serious confusion over limits &amp; nature of
black--dark-brown fill in largest &amp; most central of ashy features
([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_525]). Different from others in brown color &amp;
compaction of soil; Karissa and Shawn suspect it may have been more
similar above &amp; that chocolate brown soil is something new, but I
don't see difference. Soil

<em>[p.10: profile sketch of small pot found partially articulated in
floor below fill of room 32]</em>

<em>[p.11]</em>

<em>&nbsp;</em>inclusions of clayey material, some of which was
distinctly green in color. Soil sample of greenish soil taken -- maybe
try to test for potassium content (fertilizer?). Limits are very
irregular, &amp; I wonder if we're not looking at a planting pit for a
small tree (would have been removed by last phase of courtyard).

-- in well/cistern ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_523]), removal of soil
continues. Dyma noted on Sat. that water drips off bedrock by itself --
rather than condensation, seems to be water borne, perhaps on surface of
clay just under bedrock, from groundwater (wick effect?). Soil still
wet, but not that wet. Few finds.

-- in rm 32, removal of brown fill ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_461])
continues; Nick finishes cleaning ashy black soil from round cuts in E
corner of room. In center of fill strip along SW side, near stairs,
there is another dark soil-filled intrusion&nbsp; ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_531]). It seems to have extended to the surface of the brown
fill, under the ashy layer, although there is a slight possibility that
we have come to a new surface in the fill (less likely). There is also a
small articulated vessel <em>in situ </em>in the brown fill &lt;(see
sketch opposite) -- photographed &amp; recorded as special find
([ark_link sfi=CH05SR_2843]).

-- in rm 38, continued documentation -- geophotos this morning. In
meantime, part of team engaged in cleaning floor of rm 31 (&amp; later
will turn to rm 30) -- when documentation blocks work in rm 38, we'll
start to excavate &amp; sieve those floors for faunal samples.

- in stenopos, removal of fill of electric cable trench ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_533]) continues small piece of original collapse left at W
corner of 2004 exploratory trench near crossroad. When cleaning of
mod<em>[ern]</em> fill complete, that will be taken off as only
uncontaminated section of original stenopos collapse.

-- in main road, boundaries of modern trench for electric cable
([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_533]) are defined, &amp; remaining collapse is
determined to be original. Begins to be removed from SW end, leaving
tile collapse beneath.]]></content:encoded>

-- tomb 4&nbsp; ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_539]) -- continued excavation
shows layer of disarticulated remains similar to t. 1; series of skulls
stacked in neat rows appear at SW end. The SE side of the tomb is
clearly severely disturbed by the bomb (?) that damaged the adjoining
wall of the chapel. Several bones can be seen sticking out at odd
angles, and stones have been forced into the soil of the tomb. Some
bones have calcium carbonate concretions, and there were several large
chunks of calcium carbonate in the upper layer of stones over the tomb
-- it is not clear if this material is decayed bedrock, mortar from the
church, or, as seems to have been noted for t. 3 in 2001/2, a layer of
lime sealing.

-- in courtyard trench, Shawn &amp; team continue to clean layer of
yellow pebbly soil ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_538])&nbsp; to establish
limits, and remaining ashy pits are removed ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_524]).
Yellow seems to be present only ca. 1m out from walls on NW &amp; NE
sides, irregular outline elsewhere.

-- in well/cistern, continued excavation of same layer of fill&nbsp;
([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_520]). Some articulated late Roman ceramics,
including large parts of an amphora -- what is date of filling event?
Use?

<em>[p.12: upper part of page contains a sketch of numbered flying
sections across courtyard and room 38; lower part of page contains
sketches of the broken slab paving on the floor of t. 4 and of the
relation between t. 4, t. 5, and the NW wall of the church]</em>

<em>[p.13]</em>

-- rm 32: Nick &amp; Rose continue to remove fill -- pit w<em>[ith]</em>
ashy fill in [ark_link cxt=CH05SR_460] is cleaned, while Nick goes down
through clayey tan fill to NE. Bedrock strip id<em>[entifie]</em>'d in
2004 continues; cut seems to be deliberate (?). Finds -- ceramic, glass
-- similar to those in 2004 on other side.

-- rms 30 &amp; 31: surface cleaning proceeds in preparation for
excavation and sieving of surfaces for faunal remains.

-- rm 38: excavation of intact wall-fall proceeds ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_512]) ; in lower levels, soil reveals patches of yellow clay,
probably decayed mud plaster from walls. Extra course against wall
appears on NE inside face as well. Visible below brown collapse soil is
grayer layer w<em>[ith]</em> charcoal inclusions, apparently many tiles
-- intact tile collapse &amp; burning ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_535])?

-- stenopos: remains of wall collapse removed ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_423]); tile collapse beneath ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_434])
begins to be cleaned. Rest of human body found last year revealed
beneath tile collapse; present only to knee; perhaps lower legs removed
by animals.

-- main street: direction of attack on wall collapse ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_516]) changed to move SW to NE, in order to leave area for
cleaning. Opinion of Anton and Pavlo that collapse is intact -- no
modern finds, Byz<em>[antine]</em> ceramics.

-- rm 38: cleaning of layer reveals what seems to be final layer of tile
fall &amp; wall erosion in room; higher along walls ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_512]). Two stones of internal stair in W corner accidentally
picked off &amp; then put back in place.

-- tomb 4 ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_539]): second layer of disarticulated
bones cleaned &amp; removed; again, concentrated along NW side. Series
of 9+ skulls at SW end; they &amp; other bones are resting on very flat
yellow cover slabs, missing along SE side but perhaps disturbed (flat
similar stone off to that side) -- covering of original tomb? Lower
course of stones along SE side also visible.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Standard
procedure: clockwise from tomb.

-- tomb 4 ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_539]): becomes even more confusing this
morning, &amp; chase after osteo<em>[logical]</em> material I think
further confuses the issue. Area of t. 4 is emptied, at foot, comes down
onto bedrock, but with a regular cut parallel to the wall of the tomb;
from <em>[skeleton] </em>waist level up, tomb is covered by flat slab
that sits on a couple of stones with an incasso. One broken piece that
has been off to the side for several days finally becomes totally clear
-- it is the missing piece of the slab, deposited upside-down as if it
had been turned up directly from its original position. To the SE of the
tomb, where we had assumed there was only disturbed soil from
destruction, there actually appears another (earlier?) tomb (t. 5). It
shares its NW wall with t. 4, which appears to cut it, and is full of
disturbed skeletal material. It seems to extend underneath the wall of
the church, so if it was opened repeatedly it would need to have been
under a threshold. See sketch opposite.

-- courtyard: excavation of yellow-orange layer begins ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_538]) -- some confusion, but seems to be relatively thin.
Below W corner, where layer forms corner, there is some very regular
squarish structure in bedrock (?) with clay deposits. Flying sections
done in this room for the first time today.

<em>[p.14: upper part of the page: sketch of the section of the shaft of
the well at the N end of the courtyard; middle of the page on the left:
sketch of intaglio signet gem from fill of t. 5; lower part of the page:
on the left, sketches of two hypothetical reconstructions of
stratigraphic section of church wall and t. 5; on the right, sketch plan
of church and tombs 4 and 5]</em>

<em>[p.15]</em><em>&nbsp;</em>

-- rm 32: complete - excavation down to bedrock. Odd but extremely
regular linear features that appear to be cuts in bedrock ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_551]) ; clear that they do not continue into rm 29, though
they may appear again in 28 (some continue under dividing wall). Brown
fill extended to bedrock except -- as visible in section -- in a small
lunate cut in bedrock along SW side of the room, where fill may have
been slightly different (not excavated separately). Nick and team move
to rm. 33, where they begin to remove hearth feature in E corner
([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_555]).

-- well/cistern ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_520]): continues to be excavated.
Potential new context id<em>[entifie]</em>'d at end of day yesterday
ruled out; same fill. Beneath clay level cut again visible in underlying
bedrock (see sketch opposite).

-- rm. 38 ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_535]): continued cleaning of collapse;
after some consideration, it is decided that the slightly grayer layer
is in fact the same as the soft, fine brown layer that had been removed
to date. Quick trowel cleaning &amp; photo followed by careful
excavation of large stones in an attempt to reveal possible tile
collapse beneath. Among fragments visible after cleaning is another
carefully worked arch block with incasso for a window. In N corner is a
small pile of pebbles and broken tile -- seems to be a separate deposit.
This and other tiles along sides appear to rest on more compact, harder,
smoother brownish-grey layer w<em>[ith] </em>charcoal inclusions --
Italo interprets as decay of mud plaster on walls.

-- stenopos ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_434]): cleaning continues. Tile fall
much less pronounces as one moves to the NW. NW end left dirty for
ongoing work in 38. Steve and Olga begin to remove geotextile covering
upper torso of body in street.

-- rm 33: Nick &amp; co. return to this room to remove visible surfaces,
starting w<em>[ith]</em> hearth feature in E corner ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_555]). Upper layer of ash &amp; metal ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_508]) covers a more defined depression filled with ash and
metal debris; a separate patch, probably planned as the same original
layer, also fills an irregular oval cut. Not yet clear if concentration
of stones in S corner is simply leveling fill or a separate layer.

-- main street: excavation of rocky collapse (or fill?) ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_516]) is completed up to line of electric cable trench.
Cleaning of sparse tile collapse ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_579]) beneath
begins from SW end.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[-- tomb 5
([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_552]): situation becomes slightly clearer as
outlines of earlier tomb, lined with monumental blocks, become clearer.
Tomb seems to have been uncovered during church construction, stones on
NW &amp; part of NE side removed (for use in wall?), whole SW wall
reused under church wall. Still some confusion over nature of fill,
which has lots of human bone from individuals of various ages, including
children -- is this the fill removed from the earlier tomb, or is it
related to the disarticulated material in t. 4? Two hypotheses sketched
out opposite: one, church built, tomb emptied &amp; refilled,
foundations laid, &amp; in use of t. 4 human skeletal material deposited
b<em>[e]</em>tw<em>[een]</em> tomb &amp; wall of church; and two, tomb
emptied &amp; all refilled w<em>[ith]</em> same material, on which
church walls built -- here, bones would belong to original occupants.
Ceramics, at least at first glance, seem to Larissa to be no later than
10th c, so will be important for dating of church. In support of
hyp<em>[othesis]</em> 1, more bones along side shared w<em>[ith]</em> t.
4; in support of hyp<em>[othesis]</em> 2, no limit between the fill of
the tomb &amp; the fill under the wall &amp; the fill w<em>[ith]</em>
bones (&amp; how could church wall sit on pillar of fill?).

<em>[p.16: blank]</em><em>&nbsp;</em>

<em>[p.17]</em>

-- courtyard trench ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_538]): removal of yellow soil
complete, cleaning continues. New layer of yellowish soil visible in
roughly square area around square bedrock feature now visible in
surface; that feature seems to be related to stratigraphy in that area.
Elsewhere, brown soil with ceramic &amp; bone ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_550]), patches of black burnt-seeming soil. Remaining ashy
pits emptied; one produces very large piece of slag.

-- well/cistern ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_520]): still going down. Soil
wetter; finds rare, include bone, tile, some small ceramic frags.

-- rm. 38 ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_535]): stones in brown-gray silty soil
continue to be removed. More tiles below, but not as many as one would
hope to find in intact collapse. No signs of burnt wood; also,
depressingly, less tile fall in street in this area. Some signs of floor
surface -- bedrock in area of stairs &amp; potential door to street,
beaten-earth (apparently) in patch below tiles in S corner. Cleaning in
morning. Soil continues to include patches of yellow clay and
concentrations of sea grass (from roof &amp; walls, presumably).

-- stenopos ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_434]): remains of skeleton from last
year excavated, joined to remains found this year. Head present after
all -- but face missing (poor preservation). Bones in burnt patch, some
show signs of burning. After geophotos &amp; recording of skeleton as
separate context, excavation from under tiles begins.

-- rm 33 ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_508]): excavation of ashy deposits in
floor pits in NE half of room continues. Slag, metal objects, regular
debris present. Will be planned &amp; mapped when complete -- work
progressing rather slowly.

-- main street ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_579]): remains of tile collapse
&amp; street surface continue to be cleaned. No good visible evidence
for presence of main drain.

Generally, we decide to move winch out of 2004 slab pit in order to
begin excavation of courtyard/back room levels. If slabs are indeed
another (intact) tomb, we have to finish it this
year.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Notebook entry
written after end of work -- busy with second geophoto test in rm 38,
other tasks.

-- tomb 5 ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_552]): continued excavation of brown
fill; more bones found in careless deposits, mixed w<em>[ith]</em>
animal bone including a dog skull. At one point in layer, fill of large
rocks is distinct enough for Gordana to take a photo &amp; spot heights,
although there is nothing to distinguish this level as a new context. By
the end of the day, the tomb is emptied -- no new info<em>[rmation]</em>
above the bedrock-cut base. Sides seem to be plastered w<em>[ith]</em>
plaster similar to that of church apse; some areas could be interpreted
as mortar with calcium/lime base w<em>[ith]</em> small frags of ceramics
-- but this material is fragile and only on the face of the wall, and
this may be simply the plaster backing. The uppermost course on the SE
side seems to have been dressed to a line after setting -- some tool
marks beneath plaster. Masonry is not ashlar after all -- instead, large
regular blocks in regular courses with tile levelling &amp; plaster
facing. After lunch, I clean the bedrock bottom again &amp; define the
wall

<em>[p.18: sketch of distribution of layers beneath stone collapse in
room 38]</em>

<em>[p.19]</em>

stones further. Only additional evidence for dating is from a place in
the SW wall where a stone seems to be missing just above bedrock:
several frags of pottery from brown damp soil that may or may not be
same as fill (one frag seems to be behind a stone w<em>[ith]</em>
plaster around it). The one that seems very datable is almost certainly
late Hell<em>[enistic]</em> or later -- shiny, red slip with bead and
reel molding along rim, either ES/Pergameme or (from fabric) much later
-- Africana? No help there -- still doesn't explain relation of this
tomb &amp; the chapel. One coin from fill today -- Larissa thinks 10th
c.

-- courtyard ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_563]): apparent fill of trench along
NW wall defined; remaining area in crescent along edge of large
irregular cut in center of area given a new number (it is less dark
chocolate colored than the ashy soil and has several stones &amp; tiles
set in it -- packing for edge of cut?); large pit clearly visible after
rain just to S is defined and excavated. Although dimensions on
horizontal <em>[plane] </em>are large (&gt;1m in diam.), it is very
shallow &amp; comes down onto bedrock after ca. 10cm.

-- well: new layer ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_565]) -- clay under the brown
fill, probably eroded from clay seam just above. On top of clay the
skeleton of a medium-sized dog. Under clay a new layer of rocky fill
with very little soil between the stones. Still very little material,
though above the clay I found -- during a descent to check up -- another
Roman brick w<em>[ith]</em> signs of burning, v<em>[ery]</em>. similar
to bricks and material in "burnt layer" at bottom of first layer of
bedrock.

-rm 37: work begins in afternoon w<em>[ith]</em> section cleaning.
Several lenses of burnt earth, ash, charcoal are visible beneath an
uppermost gray fill ca. 10-15cm thick ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_575]).
Stratigraphy will be complicated. Shawn supervising; after cleaning,
begins to remove gray layer along NW section in area. Preliminary
investigation tends to suggest different stratigraphy on either side of
the late (removed) wall that ran into the fill of the pit.

-- rm 31 ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_367]): during slow period in rm 38 while
documentation activities taking place, Harvey, Olga, Jessica H., Boris
set to removing 10cm pass of last surface of this room/courtyard. All
the soil from excavation in this surface will be sieved , mainly to
collect faunal remains; the same will be true of the floor of rm 30,
which we also plan to investigate. (5mm sieve mesh)

-- rm 38 ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_535]): work stops after sparse tile
collapse is cleaned; geophotos &amp; drawing done. Collapse seems to
have more tiles along SE side of room; in NE side, where there are
stairs, the bedrock seems to have been used as the bottom riser, and
there may be some sort of platform in the N corner of the room, where
there is an odd deposit of rounded pebbles, few tiles, and a hard layer
that may be a surface. In front of the second wall along the NW wall of
the room (probable stair support) there is a substantial, roughly
circular depression into which tiles &amp; other elements of collapse
seem to spill -- including two large squared blocks that may represent a
pier at the corner of the stair support. Amid the tile collapse are
several smallish, very regular, square terracotta elements, ca. 20cm on
a side -- could be broken tiles, but should not be ruled out as paving

<em>[p. 20: on left, sketch of bedrock cuts and fill below t. 4; on
right, sketch of surface of fill 519 in room 33]</em><em>&nbsp;</em>

<em>[p.21]</em>

tiles for an upstairs floor.

-- stenopos ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_434]): excavation of fallen tile layer
begins. In roughly same area as skeleton, two burnt beams found -- one
longer but more fragmentary, other shorter but well-preserved. Given
"wood" find numbers, mapped, geophoto<em>[graphe]</em>'d; conservators
called out to attempt a lift, in the hopes that enough rings will be
present for dendro<em>[chronological]</em> dating. Experimental lift
with foam on the more poorly-preserved example.

-- rm 33: Nick &amp; Jessica &amp; Dan finish excavating ashy fill of
circular &amp; irregular pits and cuts in early floor (?) of room,
mainly along NE wall ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_508]). Situation in the rest
of the room is confused: the hard-pack, w<em>[ith]</em> few inclusions
([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_451]), gives way in an indefinite manner to a
loose soil fill of animal bones and ceramics (apparently a levelling
fill) ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_519]). I would prefer to understand the
hardpack as an early use surface &amp; the rest as fill, but I don't
know where the contemporary floor in the rest of the room has gone. In
addition, the high line of stones in similar soil in the S corner of the
room is starting to look like it may be the remains of an earlier wall
-- follows bedrock cut along SE wall in slightly too straight a line to
be dismissed as casual.

* in circular/irregular pit in E corner, two interesting elements: 1)
large fragment of hardened soil with ash and iron slag concretion on
surface, tossed into fill at an angle (clearly visible in section); 2)
hardened dark brown soil at bottom of feature, clearly distinct from
fill, with two circular impressions. Not clear if latter extends under
limits of cut or should be associated with its use.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Again, entry after
end of working day. After work yesterday &amp; during work today, Cathy
and Inga lift part of a piece of wood -- we'll attempt to use it for
dendro<em>[chronological]</em> analysis, if we can get a good section;
we also take a sample for potential carbon-dating.

- tomb 4/t. 5: slabs set in bottom of t. 4 (&amp; clearly in phase with
that tomb, as well as perhaps w<em>[ith]</em> t.5 -- plastered to t.4
headstone) are lifted. Beneath is a solid, dense, brown fill&nbsp;
([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_552]) containing bones &amp; what appears to be
late Roman or early Byzantine pottery. This fill continues, without
interruption, under the headstone of t. 4 and to the NW, in the area
where a large circular cut has been made in bedrock. The wall of t. 5
backs up against this fill -- not clear if it was built up against a cut
in that fill or if the fill was deposited after the construction of the
tomb. Under the double wall of t. 4, flat stones look
increasing<em>[ly]</em> like the ends of paving slabs (see sketch
opposite). Situation is even more confused than before. Excavation
ceased until larger area of courtyard to be opened.

-- courtyard: brown fill ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_563]) along NW wall
determined to be fill of foundation trench for that wall, emptied.
Clayey orange fill ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_562]) of circular feature just
to SE also emptied; beneath, an even harder-packed clay layer. Sequence
of cuts &amp; fills -- and their purpose -- growing increasingly
obscure.

<em>[p. 22: sketch of bedrock cuts under rooms 33 and 36, with possible
area of 9th-11th century sunken-floor building shaded]</em><em>&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</em>

<em>[p. 23]</em>

-- well ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_565]): beneath layer of clay, largely
sterile fill of large stones continues. We decide that we can't risk
losing the work of that team for two more weeks w<em>[ith]</em>out any
guarantee of finding the bottom, and close work in the well for the
season. Team will move to gray soil over slabs to N.

-- rm 31 ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_367]): continued removal of 10 cm of
floor level for sieving. Cross pendant found in sieve from this layer
([ark_link sfi=CH05SR_2981]). By end of excavation day, pass is almost
to stairs to upper floor of rm 38.

-- rm 38: drawing continues in morning. Test of time and accuracy of
hand planning at 1:50 vs geophotos from ladder continues. Currently,
drawing is ca 5 hrs in field; photos are 1 hr for 2 people in field,
plus another 15 hrs for one person referencing &amp; making
mosaic/catalogue. When drawing complete, excavation resumes from SE end
of rm --removal of thickest part of tile collapse ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_535]). In S corner, fragments of a pithos apparently in situ
are found -- removed before can be photographed, but position taken with
total station ("other find" category reinstituted).

-- stenopos: removal of tile collapse ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_434])
continues. Segment near rm 38 still left for barrow transit <em>[that
is, to provide a surface over which wheelbarrows can pass to the spoil
heap]</em>; not yet on geophotos. Treatment of beam remains as mentioned
above.

-- main street: tile collapse along SE wall of bldg (complex 3)
geophoto'd -- note presence of larger pieces of carbonized wood, again
probably burnt beams. Limits of this deposit may be result of modern
intervention in street -- but could also represent fall of porch roof
(or at least roof slanted to street over rm 33). Two large stones set up
against outside wall may support first idea.

-- rm 33: excavation of surface or layer ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_451])
under ashy patch begins, after ash-filled pits are fully emptied.
Starting to seem that line of rocks in S may be related to some of cuts
in rm 36 bedrock -- possible that in this corner are some of the few
traces of dark-age habitation. If so, building probably in mudbrick and
timber w<em>[ith]</em> sunken floor, possibly postholes for posts to
carry roof tree. Alignment 5-7º off alignment of final structures of
block (see sketch opposite). Removal of layer still somewhat tentative
-- concern over lack of clarity in relation of various apparent visible
layers to each other.

* NB: Sasha Arkhipov called his father last night to ask about intaglio
signet -- AS says certainly glass, paste, since dark blue color isn't
natural. Quite possible as interp, though I'm bothered by hardness and
survival of design, lack of patination. <em>[gemstone later determined
to be banded agate, which does have a blue
variant]</em>]]></content:encoded>

on tombs in church closed -- some cleaning of latter for Allyson's
drawing. Boris Z. has left, replaced by another Simferopol student
called Alexei.

<em>[p.25]</em>

-- in courtyard, continuing confusion. Brown layer ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_550]) with bones &amp; stones removed in preliminary 5-10cm
pass, but this reveals complex situation at NW end. In hollow in center
of bedrock, at NW end, another orange clay layer ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_562]) , apparently just over bedrock, containing frags of
roof tiles. Next to that, a medium brown layer ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_577]) w<em>[ith]</em> large rocks (W corner of trench), which
seems in turn to be cut by a feature ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_588]) filled
with an ashier dark brown soil ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_576]). This seems
to sit directly on bedrock; on the other side of a slight rise in the
bedrock, the same feature seems to cut a harder grayish layer ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_578]) . This, in its turn, is under the brown layer, but its
limit to the SE is unclean. Paleobotanical samples taken from the brown
being removed.

-- rm 37: excavation of final floor surface begins. Examination of
section in part suggests different situations on NW and SE sides,
roughly along the center line of the original last-phase wall...

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[... although the
last-phase wall clearly post-dates the division in the use of the room
(I am continuing yesterday's entry today -- couldn't complete in field).
Current hypothesis -- original fill of room sloped down to SE; gradually
filled to level with fire and hearth remains. Then final floor laid
down; then large pit cut, filled w<em>[ith]</em> rubbish, wall built on
top (see sketch opposite). Dyma &amp; co. clean off remaining pieces of
final floor surface ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_575] and [ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_596]) down to layer of fire/hearth ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_591]).

-- rm 31 ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_367]): excavation of 10 cm pass over
courtyard continues -- suddenly occurs to me that slightly harder-packed
gravelly area along the stairs has probably been excavated
w<em>[ith]</em> courtyard surface -- but in any case should have been
contemporary in last phase, so probably ok.

-- rm 30 (19/07): excavation in room -- for sieving for fish remains --
begins w<em>[ith]</em> remaining area of hearth in E corner of room
(lower levels) ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_677]). Sample taken or
paleobotanical analysis; remaining material will be sieved for faunal
remains.

-- rm 38: excavation of upper layer of tile &amp; stone collapse
([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_535]) continues in NW side of room, where it is
very thin over bedrock step &amp; deeper in area of circular feature
next to stairs. Also sieved; continues to contain tile frags, ceramics,
stones, nails (especially along SE wall, where underneath are pithos
&amp; amphora crushed in situ). Some carbonized woods remains.

-- stenopos: tile collapse ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_434]) removed &amp;
modern trench ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_510]) cleaned except in area of rm
38.

-- main street: removal of tile collapse ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_434])
outside rm 33 (19/07): under stone at E corner of block, lock of Eastern
(Iranian?) manufacture found ([ark_link sfi=CH05SR_3065]) -- extremely
good preservation, w<em>[ith]</em> lion finials. Two pieces found
slightly separate under this stone, which seems to be part of bench with
capitals (removed as special finds last year). Lock is a padlock,
probably for a chest rather than a door (too fine, bronze, door locking
mechanisms diff<em>[erent]</em>). In road due to looting?

-- two pieces of semi-fallen outside wall of rm 33 picked off by
mistake, replaced (roughly).

<em>[p.26: blank]</em>

<em>[p.27]</em>

-- rm 33: excavation of fill layer ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_519]) beneath
surface contemp<em>[orary]</em>. w<em>[ith]</em> hearth continues. In N
corner, large quantity of stones in somewhat random position -- remains
of packing of edges of earlier sunken-floor bldg? Bedrock is cut out
from walls of 33, but also seems to be cut under wall dividing 33 and
36, in conjunction with that wall -- so not clear if early building
exists or not. Earlier building could also have been divided into 3
rooms of roughly equal size...

Following reflects today's activity.

-- main street: another find under the stony collapse next to the
wall&nbsp; ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_579]): bronze vessel (or helmet?)
([ark_link sfi=CH05SR_3095]) with inside it a spearpoint, several pieces
of charcoal, apparent iron handle (?), fragments of a couple of pieces
of glazed pottery. <em>[this object was later identified as a
copper-alloy bucket, to which the iron handle belonged; the “spearpoint”
is part of a door locking mechanism] </em>Soil from inside taken for
flotation; charcoal from inside taken for possible carbon dating;
photographed &amp; shot in.

-- rm 38: depression in NW side turns out to be ovoid rectangular pit
w<em>[ith]</em> bedrock cuts along side &amp; channel apparently leading
to it ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_601]). Filled w<em>[ith]</em> tile collapse,
so open at time of destruction.

-- courtyard: increasingly complicated situation, w<em>[ith]</em> series
of cuts and fills in irregular (usually circular) pits. Currently, there
seems to be a dark ashy fill (in two layers) which is the latest
([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_576] and [ark_link cxt=CH05SR_587]); this in turn
fills a cut in a hard gray layer to the SE ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_578])
&amp; a rocky fill to the NW (?). The rocky fill covers the edge of the
layer beneath the upper orange layer, which is filled with broken tiles
([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_593]). This fill in turn fills a circular cut in
bedrock ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_598]). Tiles seem to be medieval -- again,
issue of dating of construction of house (construction trench later than
this, or earlier? When was pit filled?)

-- rm 31 ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_367]): in angle near blocked door &amp;
blocked wall, lots of small finds, including many metal objects. 2
possible cuppels or ceramic vessels used as crucibles, in one case for
gold refining. <em>[these were later determined to be crucibles]
</em>([ark_link sfi=CH05SR_3069] and [ark_link sfi=CH05SR_3098])

-- in unexcavated area <em>[of the main street, between the dig site and
the modern road]</em>, backhoe begins to dig. Comes across very flat
mortar/concrete (?) construction slightly w<em>[ith]</em>in line of
monastery wall on Kost<em>[s]</em>yushko plan –
interp<em>[retation]</em> not clear, but certainly 19th-20th c. Also an
intact cannonball.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Entry written
after end of work day -- too busy. Note ongoing excavation in rm 37 in
afternoon (discussed w<em>[ith]</em> main entry below).

-- courtyard: ongoing removal of various pits &amp; fills, including
remainder of brown layer ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_563]), ashy black layer
in pit (?) against section ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_587]), and bottom
(different) layer of tile &amp; brown earth in pit in middle of NW side
([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_593]), near foundation trench of NW wall. Two
small pits/holes in bedrock under ashy layer, but otherwise no
particular sense to developments in courtyard. Preliminary analysis of
ceramics gives tentative 13th c. date to almost everything in courtyard,
including fill of t. 5.

<em>[p.28: middle of page: sketch of room 38 floor surface, with oval
pit; bottom of page: two sections of pit showing last use
surface]</em><em>&nbsp;</em>

<em>[p.29]</em>

-- rm 37: excavation in both morning &amp; afternoon. Situation is
confusing, despite some visible layers in section. On NE side ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_592]), substantial amount of pit wall removed under the
assumption that burnt patch continued beneath; although may be slightly
out of sequence, orange patch of burnt earth does seem to be more
complicated than it first appeared -- runs deeper along NE wall, perhaps
actually under soil to NW rather than over it. On SW side, only stable
reference point is patch of burnt earth, ash &amp; charcoal against
section ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_591]) -- seems to sit on a surface and be
covered by grayer pebbly brown soil ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_575]) on NW
side. Removal of that soil &amp; of remainder of wall sitting on it
begins, extends around NW side. We are probably being more cavalier with
this stratigraphy than we would under ideal circumstances, but it seems
far more important to uncover the slabs by the end of the season than it
does to be completely certain of the microstratigraphy of something that
is almost certainly a dump (note to any future readers -- I know that
sounds like defensive justification, but it really is true).

-- rm 31 ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_367]): The S wing has now been excavated
to a level much lower than the first 10cm pass in the W wing, and has
produced a high number of small finds &amp; evidence of fine
metalworking (copper &amp; gold). We turn to the W wing again to bring
it down to the same level; all soil still being sieved.

-- rm 38: depression along NW side turns out to be, in fact, a feature:
a squared oval pit with a channel or depression leading into it and a
groove in the soil running around the edge ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_601]).
In the middle of the NW wall, against the stair base (?), is a flat rock
with a small circular cut -- post base? At the W corner, the groove
continues under the stair (?) construction; initially it seemed to be
another hiding-place, but now more likely interpretation is a cut to
seat the wood-and-wicker structure that probably sat in the groove and
enclosed the pit (only way to explain the way earth walls were retained,
and fits well with consistent presence of charcoal at the bottom of the
groove<em>[)]</em>. Possibly an animal pen; apparently other parallels
from Late Byz<em>[antine]</em> Chers<em>[onesos]</em>. On the other side
of the room, vessels broken in situ are removed. Some evidence of burnt
wood, but not as much as one would expect if the room had been subject
to the same sort of fire that destroyed the rooms along the E side of
complex 3. Post-destruction salvage operations? Could also explain rm
36... (see sketch and section, opposite).

- Note also possible alignment of stones on opposite sides of room at SE
end -- supports for shelving? coincidence?

-- rm 33 ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_519]): Ongoing excavation of pottery
&amp; bone-rich fill under surface associated w<em>[ith]</em>
metal-working -- large quantities of animal remains,
incl<em>[uding]</em>. fish bones (as elsewhere on site). Large flattish
rock set deep in area where I had hoped for third posthole form earlier
building -- post support? Distinct difference between pile of rocks in N
corner&nbsp; ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_586]) and rest of fill.

<em>[p.30: sketch of elevation of SE wall of room 33, side facing the
main street, with sketch of section to explain collapse pattern]</em>

<em>[p.31]</em><em>&nbsp;</em>

20 July cont.

(rest of entry written 21 July)

-- main street: ongoing removal of tile collapse ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_579]), cleaning of surface below. Removal of part of outside
wall of rm 33 collapsed in situ ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_582]); some stones
less fixed, need to be removed to extract bucket (done in afternoon by
conservators). Remaining rocks left until conversations can be had
w<em>[ith]</em> Chris about how to deal with wall -- reconstruct from
blocks clearly in situ, if fallen, or simply remove? See sketches
opposite for rough elevation and section of
situation.]]></content:encoded>

(possibly in line w<em>[ith]</em> odd second wall of tomb). We cut back
the section, not keeping pottery &amp; w<em>[ith]</em>out much attention
to stratigraphy, to get a better sense of the nature of these stones –
tentatively, seem to be a wall.

-- rm 37: another wall appears under 13th c. fill here, too -- partially
destroyed, but very thick &amp; recognizable ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_607]). More or less same alignment as walls of block &amp; as
slabs, but will need to look on plan. Not yet clear if this is in phase
with slabs. Note that fill levels ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_596]), rich in
pottery and animal bone, look almost identical to fill levels in rm 33
(color, composition, type of animal bones, etc.). Fill does seem to
cover both ash in S corner ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_591]) &amp; hard,
smoother brown soil beneath it ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_620]) -- the latter
seems to slope down to the buried wall. Tips <em>[i.e.“rubbish tips”]
</em>against a ruined building?

-- rm 31 ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_367]): work in W wing progresses, reveals
pile of stones next to large ashlar block in N corner &amp; very regular
cut line in bedrock, parallel to line of stairs and in area of greater
compaction identified in 2004. Some paleobotanical sampling, ongoing
sieving.

-- rm 38 ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_580]): layer of most of articulated
sherds removed; underneath are large patches of burnt wood, very poorly
preserved. Samples of charcoal taken for C14 dating &amp;/or wood
id<em>[entification]</em>. Roughly linear features may indicate either
structural wood or furniture.

Oval feature ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_601]) along NW wall cleaned further;
good evidence for presence of wood at corner to entrance ramp &amp;
under wall at N corner. Its floor surface is different from that in the
rest of the room and will be excavated first, as the last event in the
room before collapse.

-- rm 33: ongoing removal of loose pebbly, gray-brown fill full of
bones, ceramics, tile frags ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_572]). Seems to run
very deep in E &amp; center of room, except over stone concentration in
N corner (&amp; this is beginning to look like much the same fill,
although with more stones). To the SW, a harder ground ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_636]) seems to rise along the bedrock &amp; along the
potential early wall along the SE wall of rm 33 ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_567]). The large stone that I proposed yesterday as a post
support now has a companion, and both are starting to look more like
fill than post supports.

<em>[p.32: rough sketch of bedrock below floor surface of room 30]</em>

<em>&nbsp;</em><em>[p.33]</em>

-- rm 30: work resumes on floor ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_677]) (hearth
sampled yesterday, but then work stopped). Meant to be a 10cm pass for
sieving &amp; paleobot<em>[anical]</em>. sampling; goes somewhat deeper
in the area of a possible pit in the middle SW side of the room. Another
possible pit in E corner, &amp; a square bedrock feature next to it. In
area of SE doorway, bedrock just under remains of floor. (see sketch
opposite).

-- rm 38: patch of yellow soil visible in wall of cut for pen (?)
([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_601]). Suggested by Italo to be sulfur, possible
association w<em>[ith]</em> metalworking in earlier
phase?]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>[Passage
redacted]</em> Backhoe continues to operate in fill around NE section
wall in main street area.

-- courtyard: cleaning down to bedrock complete in courtyard; in N
corner, there seems to be a patch of decomposed bedrock &amp; clay cut
at a 90º angle on the outside &amp; in a rough circle on the inside (by
foundation trenches and a pit?) ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_605]). Although it
is above the level of the bedrock elsewhere, it seems to be sterile
geological soil and will be left in situ. When the surface &amp;
sections are complete, we will extend a sounding across the width of the
courtyard to the center of the cistern in an attempt to understand the
relation between the slabs, tomb, various walls, etc.

-- rm 37: still some confusion in excavation &amp; some material might
be coming from more than one layer. On the NW side of the new wall, the
dark brown-gray fill ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_596]) continues down to a
clean tan-brown level ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_619]) below the visible
course of the wall ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_607]). The situation is
slightly different on the SE side. There, the same fill was present but
the brown layer below it was somewhat overcut, esp<em>[ecially]</em>. in
the W corner, and the layer of orange soil and ash that seemed to be a
hearth ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_591]) under the floor on the NE side was
taken out together with darker fill and perhaps part of the same brown
surface. A floor or surface level above the level of several flat rocks
on top of the slabs seems to have been reached ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_639]); one tile lies flat and broken on this surface. In
reaching the surface, however, several layers may have been removed at
once. In the S corner is a hearth w<em>[ith]</em> charcoal and a deep
deposit of white ash ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_638]) -- this is probably on
top of the brown layer, or on top of an intermediary layer of dumping.
Left until out of phase, so relationships confused.

-- rm 31: removal of floor ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_367]) complete --
sieved almost entirely, except when Roma, Olga, and Katia stopped
sieving because they weren't finding anything in the W wing. Under the
floor (ca 15cm thick) are several new surfaces/layers.

<em>[p.34: upper part of page: sketch of layers under the floor of room
31; lower part of page: sketch of layers at NW end of room 38]</em>

<em>[p.35]</em>

The most recent seems to be a level of gray-brown soil w<em>[ith]</em>
similar characteristics to those of the floor, but softer, looser, and
with more bone and stone visible on the surface ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_615]). It seems to fill a cut ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_667]) in
a smooth, compact, tan-brown layer ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_618]) along its
SE side. On the NE, there is a very regular rectangular platform that
appears to be made of a very fine mortar or cement ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_617]). At the SE end of the staircase, we also find part of
another wall with a NE-SW orientation ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_614]). A
large ashlar block against the wall shared with room 30 may also belong
to this wall, as may a concentration of stones next to it. (see sketch
opposite). In the S wing, also seems to be a new surface/layer --
slightly irregular but more or less level, with large quantity of
ceramics.

-- rm 38: final cleaning of floor level in SE part of room, topography,
photos. In NW side, floor of pit/pen begins to be removed, groove seems
to be deeper than originally excavated. Surface comes down onto layer of
soil mixed with degraded bedrock in area of entrance to area ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_602]) -- probably indicates the presence of moisture coming
down bedrock cut for access. In N corner of room, quarter-circular pit
with internal triangular void -- almost certainly on a posthole with a
post mold (or post void) ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_599]). Related to stair
structure or upper floor, or to structure in association w<em>[ith]</em>
pen? (see sketch opposite).

-- rm 33: It is becoming increasingly apparent that all the various
concentrations of stone and hard earth in this room are the products of
one massive filling event: separate tips in a single action ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_636]). The distribution of the various areas is interesting,
however, and we plan those levels &amp; take spot heights. Large
inclusions of plaster/stucco, some apparently with form, along NE wall.
Deposit seems to be harder-packed, leading down from door in a sort of
ramp -- Nick wonders if it might be from original filling activity
(compressed as people walked in w<em>[ith]</em> buckets or wheelbarrows.
(see sketch below).

<em>[sketch of fill layers in room 33]</em>

<em>[p.36: blank]</em>

<em>[p.37]</em>

-- streets: work moves back to tile collapse at NW end of stenopos
([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_434]). Now that soil from 38 is being sieved,
doesn't need wheelbarrow passage. Same as tile collapse in rest of
street, perhaps a bit less thick/fewer tiles than at SE end.

-- rm 37: afternoon: finish removal of hearth in S corner ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_591]), cleaning of next floor surface down. Sequence now
seems to be, from earliest to latest:

1) slabs([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_666])

2) some sort of spoliation/fill/collapse, w<em>[ith]</em> large stones
lying on the slabs, some tile beneath (one stone very large, flat,
worked<em>[)] </em>([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_660])

3) construction of the new SW-NE wall ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_607]), with
ground level of packed earth to SE higher than ground level of
foundation &amp; packed earth surface

4) destruction and spoliation of wall, dumping over SE floor, probably
in pile rising to SW along SE side of wall

5) creation of hearth in S corner, w<em>[ith]</em> hot, long fire that
left a great deal of powdery white ash([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_591])

6) massive 13th c. trash dumping (similar to fill of rm 33, although
more compact), over area of now-broken wall, on both sides, over lower
areas of existing dump, and over top of deposits placed on that dump
(e.g. the hearth) ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_596] and [ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_575])

7) cutting of giant pit in middle of room, through both fill &amp;
collapse ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_430])

8) filling of pit w<em>[ith]</em> trash/debris ([ark_link
cxt=CH04SR_431])

9) construction of large, poorly made wall on top of both the gray
compact fill &amp; the fill of the pit([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_437])

10) some sort of slightly different activity on both sides of the wall
(courtyard &amp; open area/alley? but wall closes it from
courtyard)]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Backhoe continues
to excavate in area of street; brings level up to meet level of road
identified in trench. Will now turn to excavation of area of road to
connect with road past museum.

-- courtyard: extension trench to SW opened; some sequence of layers as
in rest of courtyard, with gray soft soil on top ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_509]), hard gray soil with orange inclusions ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_538]), compact brown soil below that ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_550]). Small balk left between excavated area and new trench
so that Pyotr can draw section.

-- rm 37: foundation trench along SW walls of rm 30 &amp; rm 31a
identified ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_626]); rm 30 level seems to be right,
but in 31a trench may have been identified w<em>[ith]</em> orange soil
located along that wall at a higher level. Although trench makes one
line, the two segments next to the two walls are very different, in both
depth and fill. It seems likely that the wall of rm 30 was built first,
with a deep foundation trench that ran slightly deeper and wider at the
corner (to seat the quoining). The wall of rm 31a has a much shallower
trench, and uses several stones from the earlier

<em>[p.38: blank]</em>

<em>[p.39]</em><em>&nbsp;</em>

wall and from the collapse or fill to its SE. The situation elsewhere
seems clearer, too -- a floor level in phase with the early wall, a use
surface on which the hearth in the S corner was laid, and the fill
above. The latter floor level ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_639]) begins to be
removed today.

-- rm 31: excavation and sieving of layer of fill ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_615]) in W corner of the room continues; it will be followed
by excavation of layer in SE wing.

-- rm 38: ongoing excavation of fill in pit/pen ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_601]) at end of room; fill ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_621]) is
mixed trash material, with slightly different soils on each side of the
bedrock skin formed in the area of the entrance. Clearly still fill of
the cut – walls continue to be soil of distinctly different color.
Confusion in N corner, where softer soil in area of posthole determined
to &lt;be&gt; extend further, but then limits lost and a chunk of floor
surface, I strongly suspect, was excavated. Hard to say whether
perception of softer soil was accurate, but very likely that current
contours are not those of original floor. Material kept with number of
floor/battuto in that corner. Excavation of floor surface in SE half of
room begins ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_610]).

-- stenopos -- final cleaning of surface finished ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_488]). Very well-preserved street surface with small cobbles,
large quantities of animal bone pressed into the surface.

-- rm 33: excavation of fill continues. In NE end of room, appears to
come down onto more compact clean brown soil with ash &amp; charcoal
inclusions ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_647]); in this soil is set a large
chunk of very chalky stucco molding ([ark_link sfi=CH05SR_3315]), which
the conservators will lift. Many other pieces of this material have been
found, usually with moldings or at least one flat face; one has a nail
hole with a little iron left in it and what may be the remains of
painting or surfacing. It is concentrated along the NE side, but
fragments have also emerged from the ramp near the door. The fill also
contains bricks from the opus mixtum Roman constructions across the
street, some apparently burnt. Not clear if the wall along the SE edge
is still a wall or another fill event, but soil is much harder. There is
an ash-filled circular, small but deep hole near the door that I suspect
is an animal burrow rather than a human construction (too deep &amp;
narrow to be tool-made). Mice burrowing in for the grain in the
storeroom?]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Entry written
after end of work. Backhoe continues work -- removes section separating
our excavated area &amp; the main trench. Current plan is to clean
surface of road up to monastery wall, then fill in w<em>[ith]</em> earth
ramp from museum road covering linear mortar/cement feature.

-- courtyard: orange-spotted gray soil ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_538])
removed; at lower level, covers a hard, smooth more yellowish soil
running along line of 2nd wall associated w<em>[ith]</em> t. 4. This
layer seems also to be cut (or to descend) along the same rough line,
with a lower level of the same orange-spotted gray-brown soil to the NE
([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_538]). The gray-brown soil is similar in its
small-clump composition to Late Byz<em>[antine]</em> fills in other
parts of the trench.

<em>[p.40: sketch of the hearth in room 37; sketch of ivory head of
soldier from room 38 (flat plaque with attachment hole – inlay?)]</em>

<em>[p.41]</em><em>&nbsp;</em>

-- rm 37: new developments -- removal of remaining fill in S corner
reveals continuing presence of ash in that corner, now in a flat area
with both white ash &amp; burnt soil patches that seems to fill a space
delimited by unbaked clay bricks ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_637]). These
bricks seem to bound a roughly square space; one is clearly set
vertically. Some discussion about relation to the floor identified at
this level in the rest of the room ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_639]), but
seems in the end like the floor covers the structure, instead of the
structure being cut into the floor. It is also possible that the layer
removed above was, in fact, the same floor/surface level, and that it
was removed as a separate level in the area of the stove (?). Work
continues in the afternoon. (see sketch)

-- rm 31: removal of rest of fill in W corner of room ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_704]) -- comes down onto bedrock in that area, forming
irregular shape with edge of mortar (?) surface along NE side. Probably
some fill remaining under large rocks &amp; pile of small rocks in E
corner -- don't seem to be in situ, and soft brown soil with oyster
shells continues beneath.

-- rm 38: we begin removal of floor deposit in SE half of room
([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_610]); descends onto bedrock along its NW edge,
onto piles of stones elsewhere in the room. Clean brown hard-pack below
may be either fill level or earlier surface -- seems fairly irregular.
In pit/pen ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_601]) excavation of layer of decayed
bedrock near entrance ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_622]), levelling of other
fills until seems to represent single unitary fill -- contents still
suggest midden fill, fairly clean ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_668]) Good find
in sieve today from this fill -- carved bone head of warrior
w<em>[ith]</em> hole for attachment pin at neck -- from a late
Roman/Early Byz<em>[antine]</em> box or furniture decoration?

-rm 33: finally finished with fill ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_519]) -- comes
down onto a clean brown layer with some ash ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_636]),
very little inclusion of material other than small fragments of
charcoal. Ash patch in N corner on top of small layer of slightly
different material; will be removed separately. Piles of stones along SE
and SW sides are clearly set in harder-packed lighter soil, but much
fill mixed into cracks &amp; open spaces. Not clear if these stones
formed a packing or wall foundations for an earlier sunken-floor
building or simply a particularly hard-packed moment of fill -- will
attempt to determine tomorrow.

-- main street: preliminary consultation with Chris C. indicates that we
should remove rest of collapsing wall ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_582]);
they'll consolidate what's left. Drawn &amp; photo<em>[graphe]</em>'d in
preparation for removal of partially collapsed
wall.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Much pit digging
today – slow, slightly confusing, probably some layer confusion,
especially in rms 30 &amp; 37 (latter is very hard to read and very
important, so again, certain amount of precision sacrificed for speed).

-- courtyard: test trench to cistern reaches bedrock in NW half, no
traces of slabs or any construction. Along SE side concentration of
stones ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_671]) -- traces of a wall? Some stones in
similar concentration to E actually partially covered by decayed bedrock
skin -- standing open with bedrock for a long time?

<em>[p.42: upper part of page: sketch of bedrock cuts under floor of
room 30; middle of page: sketch of bedrock cuts in room
31]</em><em>&nbsp;</em>

<em>[p.43]</em>

-- rm 37: coming down gradually to slabs ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_666]) --
today removed collapse of stones along NW &amp; NE sides of area,
arrived at level of slabs -- along NE wall, only bedrock w<em>[ith]</em>
layer of clay, a couple of small flat stones; elsewhere slabs continue
both to SW &amp; to NW, with areas where only clay is present. Small
areas of burning/ash patches along older wall along NW trench edge --
one concentration of fine, deep black ash, several other concentrations
of gray ash with chocolate brown-orange borders. Mixes in with yellow
clayey layer ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_660]), not treated separately.
Clay-brick construction (of sorts) is left intact, but after today will
be documented &amp; removed ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_637]).

-- rm 30: as in rm 32, bedrock "path" down center of room with filled
cuts on either side. To SW, series of at least 3 cuts leading on
diagonal into W corner; to NE one very large cut filled with soil
ranging in color from gray-ash/orange-burnt-soil color to dark
gray-brown ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_697]) (NB: though Anton S. could not
identify a limit between the two and has treated them as one layer, they
may have been distinct, with the gray-orange layer covering the other).
In the E corner, a separate pit/cut filled with brown soil may be cut in
turn by the cut filled by the gray-orange soil. That brown soil
([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_678]) was removed at the same time as the
gray-orange ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_640]), although as a separate context.
The gray-orange appears to have covered it along the edge of the E
corner; in turn, the dark gray-brown soil appears to cover a layer of
fine, compact gray ash ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_677]). See sketch opposite.

-- rm 31: bedrock uncovered in W wing under gray fill w<em>[ith]</em>
bones ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_704]), along NW side; seems to be a slab or
cut bedrock in W corner. Rest of shallow cut comes down onto same layer
of hard light-brown fill along SE wall ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_618]);
delimited to NE by layer of mortar/cement ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_617]);
bedrock cuts in area of E corner, under large ashlar block (pit?). See
sketch.

-- rm 38: ongoing oddness -- in SE side of room, last-phase beaten-earth
surface is removed to reveal irregular hard-packed surface with deep,
narrow trench along limit with cut bedrock platform between street door
&amp; interior stairs ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_610]) . There are certainly
animal burrows in the area of this trench, and it is not clear if the
fill is loose &amp; soft because a) it was disturbed by an animal along
its whole length b) it was an area where a wooden partition or
construction was seated or c) it was an area where the fill was packed
less thoroughly because it was so close to the higher bedrock edge. In
addition, in the center of the SE side of the room, on a line with the
projecting stone construction near the E corner, there is a regular
rectangular cut block surrounded by a ring of stones (and set on stones)
([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_659]). There is a slightly softer soil in this
area, perhaps from the cut to seat this stone (seems intentional --
stones around it set deep &amp; on edge). Potential interp<em>[retation]
</em>-- post base? In the NW side of the room, the pit ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_601]) continues to descend. The difference
b<em>[e]</em>tw<em>[een]</em> the NE and SW sides continues, although at
this point the fill is being removed as one context. The two slightly
different areas are separated by a central hard-packed area, and
consistently slope down to the sides, where a softer version of the same
soil is present. Does this represent use for trash dumping/composting?
But presence of animal bones -- in any case, someone seems to have
consistently stood in the middle and dumped trash to the sides.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Entry written
after end of working day -- too busy. In afternoon, conservation &amp;
presentation decisions made -- will fill rooms w<em>[ith]</em> backfill,
level of gray clay on top; experiment with uncovered side of courtyard
w<em>[ith]</em> fill of clay on top of backfill, but clay covered
w<em>[ith]</em> small gravel mixture when wet. Trash on low side of
street cut removed, high side faced w<em>[ith]</em> clean earth from
soil heap.

Entry will begin w<em>[ith]</em> rm 33, will cover yesterday as well.

-- rm 33: layer of fill comes down onto hard, clean surface with several
irregularities ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_636]). In center, bedrock visible
(higher than at sides). In N corner, cut down to bedrock and through
floor -- vaguely circular but shallow; not very convincing as functional
cut. Next to it along the NW wall is a patch of ash covering a thin
layer of yellow soil that in turn covers the floor. Is this a short-term
hearth? The packing along the NW wall is removed; a coin is found in its
fill.

Below this surface, on Weds., we expose a lower floor with a surface of
soft, damp gray ash with charcoal inclusions &amp; patches of brown and
reddish brown ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_672]). When it is clean, four
features are visible: 1) a Roman brick from the bath set flat on it
against the SW bedrock cut; <em>[2)]</em>a circular brown patch on a
line to the NW, about 50cm away; <em>[3)]</em> an irregular cut or
disturbance along the same line, again 50cm away; and <em>[4)] </em>an
area of cut floor/bedrock with a stone set in it against the floor side,
in the same line. There is also a posthole(?) against the SE wall,
roughly in its center. (see sketch) There may be a slight soil
difference in the W corner, where in 36 there was a pit, but a limit is
not visible in the floor.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Fell asleep before
last night's entry could be finished. Will continue today with
yesterday's entry, starting from courtyard and moving clockwise.

[rp?]-- courtyard: pile of stones ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_671]) next to
second wall face (to NW) ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_682]) is removed; bedrock
reached in test trench. NW face of t. 4 is also removed, found to be
sitting on slabs ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_719]) bounded by an earlier wall
([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_682]) and ending roughly at the end of the
overlying wall. The NW wall delimiting the slab area ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_682]) has been partially removed in antiquity, but more
aggressive cleaning reveals more of its interior. The central stone in
this wall has a circular hole and a notch at the top, both sloping down
to SE &amp; area of slabs; the larger hole is partially filled with a
stone w<em>[ith]</em> its face even with the SE face of the wall, while
the interior part of the hole and the channel on top are filled with
brown silt. On the NW side, there are several bedrock cuts in the same
area as this block -- possible connection with the cistern ([ark_link
cxt=CH01PA_111])? The wall is built over the fill ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_669]) of a deep bedrock pit to the W ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_670]), which seems to be the same pit covered by the slabs at
the SW end of t. 4. The very regular circular edge of this pit is
visible on the NW side of the wall, and the narrow ridge between this
pit &amp; the cuttings near the wall should indicate that there were two
cutting phases -- one before the wall, one after or in conjunction with
it. On a preliminary basis, the tomb seems to cut this construction, and
the courtyard

<em>[p.46:upper part of page: sketch of plan and elevation of early wall
next to tomb 4, bedrock cuts; lower part of page: plan of slabs, walls,
and cuts in room 37, with elevation of SE wall]</em>

<em>[p,47]</em>

probably destroyed the NW face of the wall &amp; its connection
w<em>[ith]</em> the cistern. See plan &amp; elevation sketches opposite.

-- rm 37: slabs entirely cleaned ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_666]); hearth
removed. Seem to be a pavement, broken in places; Stas convinced that
largest block is reused wine-pressing floor. Along SE side, 3 different
walls (or maybe only 2). Latest is wall ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_693]) in
association w<em>[ith]</em> closing of courtyard in last phase,
partially destroyed by modern trench. Below that is another, under wall
([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_692]) that seems to rest on soil above a third
wall (narrower, but one face is on same line as wall just above in E
corner). The third wall ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_692]) rests on a thin
layer of abandonment over the slabs. Along the NE wall of the later
block, the construction cut is cleanly visible. The yellowish
hard-packed soil ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_660]) that covered the slabs at
the lowest level seems to be a surface associated with the use of the
first wall; the surface above (perhaps with the hearth?) may have been
associated with the second wall (unless the second wall is simply a
slightly different part of the first). We continue today on the SE side
of the wall in the courtyard, where we encounter a layer of brown fill
covering the same yellow surface that we associate with the first wall.
Material seems to indicate a 4th-5th century date for that wall &amp;
surface which puts the slabs earlier (same time as cistern?). See sketch
opposite.

-- rm 31: <em>[Passage redacted: gist is that sieving ceased, some
stratigraphic confusion] </em>Situation in W wing seems to involve some
bedrock cuts ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_724])/([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_725]),
pits of irregular size &amp; shape w<em>[ith]</em> fills of brown-tan
soil, same yellow hard-packed soil into which cut for gray fill was cut
(yellow soil overlies bedrock) ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_704]). In E wing,
pass made over soil of current uppermost layer -- brown fill, as in
other parts of room ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_709]). About 10-15 cm removed.

-- rm 38: pit finished ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_601]); came down onto
harder packed gray-yellow soil not that different from rest of fill, but
this one continued into pit wall &amp; was clearly cut by pit hole. In
SE side, removal of brown irregular hardpack ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_610]), which Italo now considers to be a surface; below it,
loose dark gray-brown fill ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_649]) with tiles, etc.
In some areas -- especially in N corner near the door -- concentrations
of stones ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_711]) that may represent earlier
structures (may also just be diff<em>[erent]</em> fill). Difference
along SE wall continues -- another large stone in situ against wall
under fill.

-- rm 30: Yesterday, lowest floor cleaned ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_678]);
in W corner of bedrock cut was a small oval hole containing the bones of
a 6-7 mo<em>[nth]</em> fetus ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_679]). Floor itself
removed today, down to bedrock. One piece of 13th century pottery near
bedrock, but very small and is probably intrusion. Rest of material is
9th-10th. Room will close today.

-- rm 33: cleaning this morning reveals 2 possible hearth features
([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_695])/([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_696]) with gray ash
and brown burnt soil, some seeds, charcoal, organic material.
Photo<em>[graphe]</em>'d and sampled, then early floor ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_672]) removed down to bedrock. Possible connection
w<em>[ith]</em> pit in rm 36 ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_471]); bedrock
channels ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_731]), possibly natural, and at least one
possible posthole cut where cut was visible in middle of SE side
([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_714]). Material seems to be quite clearly
10<sup>th</sup> c. We also remove last of packing/foundation/compact
fill ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_654]) in W corner along bedrock cut; wall
w<em>[ith]</em> tile course ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_661]) in front of door
will have elevations &amp; be photographed.

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Entry written next
day -- too much running around. Work closes today; crane on site for
overhead photos. Drives up main street, then up stenopos (tight fit but
ok) for complex 2 photos, then back to main street for complex 3 photos.
Crane cannot extend basket far enough to get good vertical shots,
especially for rm 37, but height ok for rooms closest to street.

-- rm 37: drawing holds up excavation; meanwhile, excavation of strip to
SE of SE wall ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_692]), between walls &amp; well cut.
At N end, bedrock cut with vaguely circular form (but could be square)
([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_689]); to S, large rectangular block (part of
pavement?) stretches into section from under wall. On the other side of
this block, the wall seems to be in phase with a clayey yellow soil (as
on the other side of the wall), below which is yellow-brown fill over
bedrock. The end of a second slab ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_666]) is visible
beneath the wall stones on this side.

The fill on the other side of the NW wall is also excavated; two
circular cuts (for pithoi?) ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_691]) are visible
stretching into the section wall. This wall sits on a level of yellow
fill ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_660]) below which there are depressions
filled with gray ash and covered by black ash or reddish burnt earth.

Initially we felt that these walls, which were founded on different
elements (one on the slabs, one on yellow-brown earth), were two
different walls from two different phases. This idea was supported by
the break in alignment of the NW face of the two walls. The other face,
however, seems to be continuous and to follow the natural pattern of the
slabs and ground. I now wonder if they are in fact one wall built over
the irregularities of the landscape in that area.

In the afternoon, after all has been photographed, we decide to lift one
of the slabs ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_666]). We start with a long
rectangular block along the NE side, but it is cracked in the middle. We
then move to a rectangular block along the NW, which is lifted intact.
Below it is clayey bedrock with a thin layer of brownish soil --
sediment &amp; bedding layer ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_716]), which produces
a piece of tableware of uncertain date and one tiny fragment of
1st-2<sup>nd</sup> <em>[century]</em> AD high-quality Arretine terra
sigillata. We begin to lift the largest slab, but stop when it becomes
clear that this block, too, is cracked in the middle. See sketch of
lifted block opposite. After this (this is late afternoon), excavation
in this room is closed.

-- rm 31: Mad dash at the end to get to a stopping point in this room,
esp<em>[ecially]</em> in E wing. In W wing, large circular pit
([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_727]) cut into bedrock emptied; in course of this
work, it becomes apparent that the level of hard white "stone" visible
across the middle of the room is instead a thick layer of eroded and
reconcretized bedrock ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_717]) covering a deposit of
yellow-brown fill representing a very good Hellenistic context
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_809]). A second look indicates that this area is
delimited by very deep parallel cuts in hard bedrock on either side,
leaving a sort of channel between ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_725])/([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_726]). See sketch opposite.

In the E wing, near the blocked door to 38, removal of the surface left
([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_616]) after the last pass reveals a hard-packed
brown smooth floor level (?) ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_713]). In it are
three cuts: two relatively shallow subrectangular cuts ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_706]; [ark_link cxt=CH05SR_708]) and one very deep, roughly

<em>[p.50: blank]</em>

<em>[p.51]</em>

circular cut with steep walls ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_710]). In the side
of this cut another wall is visible -- composed of three visible stones
set in a good line about 15 cm below that floor level. Once these are
cleaned, we run out of time and excavation in this area is closed.

-- rm 38: Also mad scramble to finish here -- pit ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_601]) is emptied down to bottom (1.3m deep ca.) as of
yesterday, but I want to take off the pile of rocks in the N corner of
the other 1/2 of the room ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_711]), and I also want
to start removing what seems like a unitary layer of soft brown clumpy
fill with stones &amp; tile fragments ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_649]).
Effort is not entirely successful -- we get about halfway through the
fill, starting from the SE wall; the layer comes down onto an equally
soft layer that is very distinct in color &amp; composition ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_712]): very smooth thin layer of beige to red-brown soil with
some charcoal. The benefit of this approach, however, is to reveal the
bedrock and its cuttings in the S corner of the room -- so that
situation, at least, is clear. Second looks also suggest that the
bedrock platform in the center of the room is covered by a deposit of
decayed bedrock. Probable that all of this is one fill episode, as in rm
33, but we won't know until next year.

*NB: material from rm 33 c<em>[onte]</em>xts 630 and 640 (fill against
SW wall and hearth in N corner) is mixed during washing/sorting -- all
looks 9th-10<sup>th</sup> <em>[century AD]</em> unitary, but should be
noted if either becomes crucial for dating.

-- rm 33: removal of last bits of packing ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_661]) in
doorway to 28, with tile levelling &amp; "course"; removal of remaining
bedrock fill in irregular channels ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_731]) at lowest
level. The pit from rm 36 ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_471]) does not seem to
continue into this room, although the bedrock division under the wall
between 33 &amp; 36 does not exist in this area. There is a very smooth
circular cut under the packing along the SW wall <em>[of] </em>the
larger bedrock cut -- possible posthole ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_714])?

While crane photos shot etc., bit of main road leading to monastery wall
cleaned -- bedrock shelf appears along NW side of street. Bulldozer
starts to finish w<em>[ith]</em> trash heap. Inventory in storage
<em>[shed] </em>taken (tools etc.).]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[Work closed in all
rooms. Investigations in 31 &amp; 38 will have to continue next year.
Bulldozer (backhoe) moves a bit more trash, completed, paid, departs.
Backfilling by hand begins -- in consultation with Chris Cleere, begin
with simplest rooms (33, 36, 29). 29 and 36 are basically completely
filled with soil, will await clay surfacing. 33 is much deeper,
partially filled with soil but will need another 15-20 cm to reach
original floor level with clay. At 1pm, site closed for the
season.]]></content:encoded>

work on courtyard. Dyma D., Sasha, &amp; Caitlin will work in rm 31.
Lea, w<em>[ith] </em>Ishan, Dyma M., &amp; Emily will work in rm 38.
Backfill removal continues. Room 38 is ready for excavation, which will
begin with context 712 ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_712]) (remaining fill under
earliest 12<sup>th</sup>-13<sup>th</sup> c. floor levels). Soil from
this layer will be sieved until we can determine if that strategy is
useful. Layers above in this room were sieved for faunal purposes, with
good results.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In courtyard, Shawn will begin from rm 37 --
sample trench cut on SE side of SE wall over slabs. His team will then
move toward the cistern. The initial stage will be an expansion of the
existing trench toward the well in order to clear one side for the
construction of a smaller cover <em>[for the well] </em>resting on
bedrock.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

--> <p>Rain again during the night -- first part of morning spent on
lecture for students, documentation checking for staff. By 8:30, dry
enough to work in rm 38, where 712 ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_712]) still
being removed &amp; sieved. Stone projecting from wall on stenopos side
is removed, together with the earth platform on which it sits -- taken
as 712 as well.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>We are experimenting with a different method to
capture surface topography &amp; georeference photographic information
-- using Photomodeller 5.2 in conjunction with total-station survey. The
courtyard and room 31 are both subject to this before excavation
begins.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In rm 31, excavation begins with 713 ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_713]) in the E wing. The soil is a light yellow-brown color,
fairly smooth &amp; compact; it seems to occupy the entire area exposed
in the E wing. Soon after excavation, along the blocking wall between
this room &amp; room 34, it is seen to come down onto a clayey
tan-yellow layer ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_747]) that seems to slope down to
the NW quite steeply.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In rm 38, more of the fill ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_712]) in the E corner of the room is removed, under the area
of the large stone. There is a large pile of stones ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_711]) in this corner, and although the concentration seems
distinct, the soil that fills it is similar to the rest of 712. Larissa
thinks it might be a different soil altogether, but we both agree that
it forms part of the same filling event (fills of different composition,
as in rm 33 last year). Several of the pieces of pottery are clearly
identifiable as 2nd 1/2 of 9th-early 11th c.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Also: work held up for Shawn's team for entire

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In room 38, last of 712 ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_712]) is removed. In the center of the room, it descends to a
gray layer with a concentration of fine white-gray ash in the S corner
of the layer ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_754]). It is surrounded by a dark
brown layer of soft, friable soil  ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_753]). Both
layers contain large quantities of animal bone, ash &amp; carbon,
ceramics. (seek sketch opposite). Initially we thought that the ashy
layer was the top of a pile covered by the brown layer, but further
investigation showed the gray layer to lie on top of the brown layer.
Yesterday Dyma M. defined what seemed to be the edge of a pit in the E
corner of the room, under the pile of rocks under the protruding rock we
removed. I think, however, that the "pit" is artificial -- the product
of the removal of a concentration of rocks in that area. All of these
layers, it seems almost certain, are products of the same simultaneous
fill action.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p><em>[p. 56: upper part of page: sketch of the
layers in the E wing of room 31; lower part of page: section of the
layers at the N end of the courtyard]</em></p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p><em>[p. 57]</em></p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>24 June 2006 cont.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In room 31, at the SE end of the E wing, 713
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_713]) comes down on a hard-packed clayey light
brown soil with frequent bedrock &amp; ceramic inclusions ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_749]). Over this, against the lowest course of the early wall
that has now appeared in this area, is another small patch of yellow
clay with charcoal inclusions ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_747]). There is some
confusion about the extent of the hard-packed soil (a work surface for
the 12th-c. construction phase?), which may have been slightly
overexcavated at the edge of the small pit next to the larger one; but
Dyma &amp; Sasha are sure that 713 came down directly onto a smoother,
darker brown layer below in the area of the stairs, and that 749 was
absent there (see sketch opposite). There is a small subrectangular cut
in the S corner of 749, filled with a soft dark brown soil   ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_751]). </p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In the courtyard, Shawn removes a large stone
set in the ground at the edge of Dyma's old sondage; we conclude that
this stone, and the softer brown soil in which it is set, are probably a
lower layer of fill of the trench excavated in 2001-2002. This suspicion
is confirmed by the discovery of a fragment of cannonball of Crimean War
date found at the bottom of this fill. It seems likely that the trench
itself is not a drainage trench but a slit trench from the 1850s or
1940s -- this would explain its depth &amp; the effort that was made to
break through the existing walls. Beneath the fill is a yellow clayey
layer ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_702]).</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Experiments with Photomodeller continue --
still not quite up to speed, but getting there.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph
-->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Noon -- site tour begins, supervisor by

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph
--> <p>In room 38, 754 (gray ashy fill) ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_754]) is
removed after having been drawn. Context is sieved.</p> <!--
/wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In courtyard, uppermost level of soil in new
section area is removed. In the E, it has already been partially removed
-- it is a compact soil varying in color from dark tan to ashy gray,
with frequent charcoal inclusions and small stones ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_752]). It seems to cover the slightly more friable yellow
layer ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_759]) that Dyma exposed over the slab in
this area. On a second trowelling, however, it seems that the tan soil
may be a separate layer overlying a gray ashy soil ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_755]), which in turn covers Dyma's yellow layer (see sketch
opposite). Here, too, after the extension of the edge of the trench cut
identified in 2002, Allyson draws in the new limit -- we will need to
adjust the plan accordingly.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In room 31, topo surface of uppermost layers
(747, 749, 751)  ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_747]/[ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_749]/[ark_link cxt=CH06SR_751]) taken as temporary solution
until photogram can be worked out. Then the fill of the small pit
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_751]) and the clay layer ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_747]) are removed. </p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>The remainder of 754 ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_754]) is removed in Rm 38, leaving a roughly square
depression in the surrounding loose, crumbly brown soil ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_753]). The brown soil is cleaned for a photo in preparation
for its removal. Fill contains a well-preserved coin</p> <!--
/wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p><em>[p. 58: top of page: sketch of a coin of
Basil and Constantine from room 38 fill; below that, sketch of the
layers in E wing of room 31; middle of page: section of layers in
courtyard; below that, sketch of cuts and layers in W wing of room
31]</em></p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p><em>[p. 59]</em></p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>with a monogram, perhaps of Constantine and
Basil (9th c.?) (see quick sketch of legible face opposite). When brown
soil is cleaned, will be removed (753). </p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In room 31, 751 ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_751]) is
removed, revealing rough pieces of bedrock (or stones); the pit seems to
have served for the placement of another stone, perhaps as part of the
leveling activity. 749 ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_749]) is removed over
bedrock and over the smoother, more compact dark-brown surface/layer 756
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_756]). This layer has a large quantity of
articulated sherds lying more or less flat in its upper reaches. Bedrock
cuts along the NW and SW sides are now visible; at least one angle
matches the cut along the SW side of room 38 (see sketch opposite). 756
also contains several pieces of plaster, concentrated at the S end of
the E wing -- these pieces are bright red and dark yellow in color, with
a very fine and smooth painted surface and a hard, even preparation
layer levigated with small, smooth stones. This is initially shot as an
architectural sample but then changed to be a small find ([ark_link
sfi=CH06SR_3430]), so that it can be sent to conservaton. Similar
plaster fragments were recovered from room 33? and 31? last year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In courtyard, the soft brown layer ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_757]) with ceramics that seems to be level with the courtyard
is removed on both sides of the well. To the SW, it comes down onto a
very ceramics-rich layer of slightly different brown soil near the well
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_758]), which rests in turn on yellow soil
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_759]) that extends all the way to the wall of
complex 1. It also seems to be under the ashy soil ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_755]) to the NE (see sketch opposite). </p> <!--

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph
--> <p>In the courtyard, Shawn &amp; co remove the gray ashy layer
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_755]) at the N end of the sounding, expositing the
yellow layer ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_759]) across the width of the trench.
Along the wall of room 30, there may be the fill of a foundation trench,
although they have not yet defined any clear boundaries.</p> <!--
/wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In room 38, work continues on removal of 753
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_753]), with moments of confusion about areas of
different consistency, piles of rocks, wetter or darker soil, etc. It
seems clear that these are inconsistencies due to the filling event
itself, as we saw in room 33 and elsewhere. It also seems probable that
this layer represents one filling event with individual dumps of
slightly different composition. Some detail photos are taken of
individual groups of cut wall stones in the fill -- the stones are
concentrated largely along the walls of the cut and under the wall
between the room and the stenopos. The fill here also includes small
pieces of plaster, here painted solid yellow.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In room 31, hard-packed brown layer 756
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_756]) continues to be removed. It seems to be
deeper at the SE end of the E wing; about 1.5m from the SE wall, another
smooth, lighter, compact surface (?) ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_764]) seems
to emerge under it. In the W wing, the mortar floor or patch next to the
stairs is cleaned, revealing a circular hole ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_776])
near the SE corner of the stairs. It is not clear if this layer
continues under the stairs. The two holes already present in the eroded
bedrock surface line up roughly with this new hole, suggesting to
Larissa that they may all be postholes associated with a wooden
construction. (see sketch opposite)</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p><em>[p. 60: sketch of section of layers in
courtyard on the 27th and 28th of June]</em></p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p><em>[p. 61]</em></p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>27 June cont.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Anton, Kristina and Yura open a 1m wide trench
across the stenopos, running from the wall of rm 35 to the trench cut
for the electric cable. They remove the final layer of the street,
uncovering a shallow, narrow strip of compact brown soil along the wall
of room 35 and a very clear underlying surface ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_767]). The underlying surface varies in color and composition
from a dark reddish-brown, with large chunks of burnt brick, ash, and
metal slag, along the sides and a lighter grayish-yellow green color
with clay lumps in the middle. The burnt ceramics seem to cover the
lighter clayey layer, which may be associated with the construction of
the box drain that we assume is present here as well as downslope.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In room 38, fill 753 ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_753]) seems to come down onto a smoother, less rocky, fairly
even layer of dark brown soil ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_768]). Too early to
tell if this is a surface. Large quantity of nails.</p> <!--
/wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In room 31, the floor (?) of coarsely levigated
mortar near the stairs is removed. Work continues on removal of
hard-packed dark tan-brown layer in E wing ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_756]).</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In courtyard, situation becomes clearer. Along
NE side of the trench, there is a softer brown soil ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_762]) which seems to fill a cut ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_763])
in the yellow layer ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_759]) currently being removed.
This cut -- parallel to the wall, ca 50cm wide -- is almost certainly a
cut for the foundation trench of room 30. On the other end of the
sounding, however, the yellow layer seems to be uninterrupted, although
the wall of complex 1 extends well below its surface. It is possible
that the latter wall sits in a slit trench or against the very edge of a
foundation trench in the yellow layer, &amp; hence the foundation cut is
no longer visible. If this is not the case, we might have a phasing
problem.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph
--> <p>Questions for photos: was 31a down to bedrock? Was sondage beyond
room 37 down to bedrock? answers -- no and no</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In courtyard, Shawn &amp; co. remove the rest
of yellow fill ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_759]). In the SE end, it becomes
clear that 759 covers the fill ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_770]) of a pit
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_771]) that is subsequently cut by the foundation
trench ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_763]); this early cut also cuts a harder,
more compact yellow layer ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_772]) that seems to have
accumulated around the slabs after they began to be robbed (see sketch
opposite).</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In room 31, it is determined that the irregular
bedrock edge along the outside of the wall of room 30 is actually
another skim of decayed bedrock ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_775]), perhaps
created in the context of the construction of the 12th-13th c. building
complex. It covers and mixes a bit with the surface of 749 ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_749]) and also seems to cover 756 ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_756]). 756 has now been removed, revealing another compact
brown soil -- 764 ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_764]) -- with an irregular
surface rising to the SW and sloping off steeply towards the course of
stones along the NE side of the room. </p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In room 38, fill 753 ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_753]) continues to be removed -- ceramics, large cut building
stones, nails, a well-preserved coin of Constantine &amp; Basil (as
previous, but much more legible). </p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In the street <em>[i.e. the stenopos]</em>, the
soft brown soil previously identified as a side-walk turns out to be the
fill ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_766]) of a foundation trench ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_769]) (?) along the wall of room 35. The trench is about 25cm
wide and 25cm deep; it seems to be cut in the surface below the topmost
surface. This is unexpected, since we assumed that more</p> <!--

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p><em>[p. 63]</em></p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>road surface would have been deposited in the
time after the block was constructed. If these relations are accurate,
and if the trench does not have some other explanation, we may have some
questions about phasing. </p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>I'm having second thoughts about the Crimean
War trench (<em>ed. note: this trench running across the courtyard and
room 25 was identified as modern by Paul Arthur's team in 2002:
[ark_link cxt=CH02PA_171], [ark_link cxt=CH02PA_173]</em>), mainly
because a second set of concrete bases for fenceposts run right behind
it. This concrete looks just like that used for the fenceposts along the
massive bank &amp; ditch behind the site -- we take some points to check
against the plan &amp; photo.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph
--> <p>In the street, the yellowish strip down the middle gets its own
number ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_778]); Anton decides it fills a cut
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_779]) in the reddish surface of the earlier road
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_767]), and removes it first. As anticipated, it
comes down onto the cover slabs of the box drain  ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_489]). </p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In room 38, what seemed to be a brown
hard-packed surface over the yellower beaten earth ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_784]) below turns out to be -- we think -- a more compact
trampled part of 753 ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_753]). There is still a patch
of gray ashy soil in the same place as there was in the layers above,
and although it is distinct from the brown by color, its interface is
unclear. Both layers have large crumbs, voids, and lenses of especially
soft or loose soil, as well as jumbled ceramics and large quantities of
animal bone -- characteristic of fills. Although we may be confusing a
final surface in this room (or removing it), I am almost certain, on the
basis of the lack of compaction and the general quality of the soil,
that we are still dealing with mixed fill.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In room 31, Dyma et al. continue to remove the
thick, compact dark brown-medium brown soil ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_764])
in which (under which?) a large chunk of brick &amp; mortar wall with
plaster surface was found yesterday. Dyma feels that this chunk occupies
a small pit, which he begins to define. The surface into which the pit
is cut, however, remains unclear. (see sketch opposite)</p> <!--
/wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In the courtyard, the fill ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_770]) of the large pit ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_771]) in the
bedrock is removed and sampled. The hard yellow soil ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_772]) is cleaned in preparation for removal. </p> <!--
/wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p><br> In room 31a, I start some cleaning in
preparation for further excavation.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In room 38, excavation also begins in the cut
along the SW side of the room. There are two separate semicircles along
the edge of this cut; the southern ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_729]) seems to
be filled with a hard clay ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_780]), while the upper
level of the NW cut ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_901]) seems to be filled with
a softer, looser brown soil ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_781]). The two fills
are, for the moment, recorded as separate contexts. Still a bit of
confusion in the excavation process, with some trampling, some
recleaning, etc.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->]]></content:encoded>

([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_405]) cleaned / courtyard: fill of pit ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_770]) completely removed, yellow soil ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_772]) covering slabs removed, determined that in Dyma's 2005
trench bedrock was reached / in stenopos, fill ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_778]) of trench ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_779]) for
installation/repair of drain removed, cover slabs of drain cleaned 
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_489]) </p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>So: beginning morning of 30 June:</p> <!--
/wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In room 38, the lower fill ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_785]) begins to be removed. Work also continues on the
removal of the harder fill in the larger semicircular cut ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_729]) visible under the buttressed wall -- dark brown fill
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_790]) seems to come down onto a sandier,
yellow-tan soil that rises up under the wall <em>[ed. note: not
distinguished from 790 in subsequent excavation]</em>.</p> <!--
/wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In the courtyard, the yellow hard soil
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_772]) under the slabs (?) is cleaned. It seems to
me that this is the same soil that we found used to level bedrock under
the slabs in rm 37 last year; Shawn has given it a new number, but we
will probably make it equivalent/same as. This is the last layer above
bedrock here. </p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In the stenopos, the fill ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_778]) of the trench for the drain is removed to reveal the
cover slabs ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_489]) and, in the irregular areas left
between them and the edges of the trench, a loose fill of medium to
small stones and some ceramic fragments with many voids &amp; very
little soil matrix. This seems to be the initial stage of fill
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_778])  the cover of the drain, so it is removed
before the cover will be lifted.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Backfill is removed over the slabs ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_666]) in rm 37.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In room 31a, the uppermost layer left in 2004
begins to be removed. Samples are taken for paleobotanical analysis. It
seems to come down onto a dark to medium brown layer with large crumb
and many ceramic and bone fragments -- fill again? ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_405]) </p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In courtyard, rethink of yellow layer -- along
the well there is a lighter hard-pack with mortar inclusions that seems
much more similar to the bedding soil under the slabs in 37. A glance at
the pottery from the yellow layer now being removed shows a date in the
6th-7th c.&nbsp; -- so this soil is equivalent to the soil that was
above ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_778]), and can be related to manipulations
of the area during or after the robbing of the slabs -- creation of
Early Byz<em>[antine] </em>use surface?</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Gone from site again for most of late morning.
Apparently little happened in street; highest layer in rm 31a removed,
some modern contamination (cigarette butts); ongoing removal of lower
fill in room 38 (continues below hard-packed surface in W corner of cut,
so probably one event); removal of hard clay &amp; bedrock (&amp;
mortar/plaster?) packing layer below level of stones in courtyard,
preparation for section drawing.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph
--> <p>Previous entry probably not complete, but can catch up -- not too
much new.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In stenopos, second surface of street
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_767]) is removed, revealing what seems to be a
destruction level ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_796]) with large pithos
fragments w<em>[ith] </em>evident traces of burning lying flat on what
may be an earlier street surface. The fragments include a rim, and in
and around them are frequent pieces of charcoal. They seem odd as a
street surface, especially since the fragments seem to be related to a
single vessel or vessel type. &nbsp;They seem to rest on a lower
(street?) surface that is more compact ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_797]).
Although we initially thought this might be a cobble surface based on
broken ceramics, the uniformity of the extent of the broken sherds, the
traces of burning, and the relatively unworn edges of the pottery
suggest it was not used as a street surface.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In room 38, excavation of fill ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_785]) in larger cut continues, with no sign of change. Soil
continues to be sieved. Layer on other side of bedrock spit is cleaned
from detritus accumulated over the year -- it seems to be 606 ([ark_link
cxt=CH05SR_606]) from CH05, although a squarish cut in the N corner is
no longer visible. It is possible that 606 was removed without
documentation, since one plan indicates that bedrock (or the decayed
bedrock layer?) was reached in this area. </p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In room 31, layer 764 ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_764]) continues to be removed -- in the S corner, it comes
down onto a yellow-white-gray layer of clayey ash and charcoal fragments
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_795]), over which sit several tiles lying flat,
apparently on a surface. Looking at the section that has been left under
the wall <em>[the wall separating room 31 from room 25/34] </em>it seems
less likely that there were two pits than that there was one pit with a
fill that spilled up over its lip and rose in a sloping heap against the
wall. This would explain why the first cut identified seemed to grow
wider with every pass. The tiles visible on the lower surface, under
&amp; in 764, seem to be early Byz<em>[antine]</em>. A lamp with traces
of burning, almost whole, was found in this layer. </p> <!--
/wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In the courtyard, the surface of the court is
cleaned back. It is a fairly deep cleaning -- 2-4cm -- and I am worried
that the final-phase surface has been removed, but Shawn feels that the
soil removed was only recent accumulation. He also feels that this soil
is very different from the last surface in the rest of the court --
little metal waste, lighter color.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph
--> <p>In stenopos, layer of collapse (?) ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_796]) is
removed to reveal a very clear cobbled street surface ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_797]). The material seems to belong to the 2nd 1/2 of the
9th-11th c., at least on a preliminary reading.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph
-->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In room 38, same dark brown crumbly damp fill
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_785]) continues down. Work begins on removal of
top layer on other side of bedrock "wall" -- could be 606, last layer
recorded here last year, or could be accumulated sediment from the
winter, or could be a layer not identified last year. In any case,
assigned CH06SR0606 ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_606]), since that number was
still open.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In room 31, Dyma &amp; co. continue to remove
764 ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_764]), which seems to have a very consistent
6th-7th c. date. It lies over an ashy clay surface, on which a number of
tiles are lying flat  ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_795]). In the W corner are
fragments of a pithos and a bit of clay that seems to have served (for
Dyma) as a stand for that pithos. </p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In room 31a, Sasha continues to remove the
brown fill 794 ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_794]). It seems to fill an
irregular depression, along the sides of which decayed bedrock slopes
down to the center. It is unclear if this decayed bedrock is equivalent
to the layer in the trench in 31, but it does seem sometimes to contain
ceramics &amp; bone.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In the courtyard, Shawn &amp; co remove the
second surface ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_752]) in the morning (no photomodel
made, but topo surface taken of next surface). They then begin to remove
the next layer down ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_755]), which seems to contain
some quantity of ash &amp; charcoal &amp; a large amount of ceramics. At
the other end of the church, Renata &amp; Rose &amp; Kathleen start to
excavate the area between the tombs &amp; the apse, where a large number
of disarticulated bones are visible. The soil in which they lie seems
mixed, with no clear evidence for a specific cut. It is removed as a
single context ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_798]). In it are found a bronze
pendant ([ark_link sfi=CH06SR_3613]) <em>[ed. note: actually a book
clasp]</em> [and a large fragment of stucco molding (church decoration)
that seems to depict circles or foliage ([ark_link sfi=CH06SR_3611])]***
<em>[the brackets and asterisks are explained on the following page,
where it is noted that this seems to confuse the large piece of masonry
with egg-and-dart molding from room 31 with some smaller pieces of
stucco molding from the church fill]</em></p> <!-- /wp:paragraph

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph
--> <p>No writing until after noon. I was digging in rm 31, W wing,
removing "bedrock" layer 717 ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_717])  The layer is
composed of a hard bedrock skim, dissolved and reconstituted as the
bedrock edges of the cut stood open to the air. It contains fragments of
ceramics of the late Hellenistic &amp; possibly the early Roman period,
as well as bones, a large quantity of seashells, and an unexpected
quantity of charcoal. Much of this material may actually have been
pulled up from the brown-tan layer ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_809]) below,
which has patches of burning and large quantities of bone &amp;
ceramics.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In room 31, the tile &amp; pithos fragments on
the lowest beaten-earth surface ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_800]) under 764
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_764]) are removed. In the W corner of this area,
under a pithos fragment, is a jug or amphora, the mouth of which was
covered by the fragment. Samples are taken of the loose brown soil
inside; the pot seems to have been sunk into the floor, and its contents
may be original.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In room 38, the larger square pit ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_728]) continues to descend; in the lower reaches is a
fragment of late 10th-11th c. polychrome Constantinopolitan white ware.
On the NW side in the N corner, excavation of the uppermost surface
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_606]) continues. In the N corner, where</p> <!--

frags were all scrollwork &amp; acanthus decoration"; below this, a
sketch of the SE stratigraphic section in the stenopos; below this, a

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>a pebble construction was identified in 2005,
some sea-worn pieces of pottery continue to be found. Elsewhere in this
area, the surface comes down onto an orange-tan layer with traces of
burning ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_810]).</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In the courtyard, the foundation trench
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_763]) of the wall of 30 ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_265]) is found to continue. Earlier stratigraphy may have to
be amended, however -- it seems already to be visible in the second
surface of the courtyard, and it also seems to be filled with at least
two and perhaps three separate levels of fill. Its outline is irregular
-- widens to a square roughly 50cm on a side at the N corner of the
current area of excavation. The soil from the foundation trench begins
to be excavated. </p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In the street, the previous surface ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_797]) under the ceramic destruction ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_796]) is excavated, revealing another surface with larger
stone cobbles packed in a yellow clay bedding ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_803]). On the SE side of the box drain that surface is almost
entirely worn away, perhaps through heavier traffic (though it's also
possible that it was slightly overexcavated). On this side the bedding
layer is clearly visible.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In the church last night, the conservators
consolidated &amp; lifted a piece of molded stucco cornice about 40cm
long and 25cm wide, with a strange semi-ovolo molding (see sketch
opposite)** <em>[note again here that this is inaccurate: stucco
moldings were lifted from the church, but they were not the large
fragment with the ovolo molding]</em>. Conservators are now working on
another large fragment, perhaps a pilaster capital w<em>[ith]</em>
acanthus decoration. Anthropological excavation in this area has ceased
-- apart from the skull removed yesterday, the human bones seem to have
petered out in the lower level.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph
--> <p>-- Entry in fieldbook written in afternoon -- digging in rm 31a
during the day, plus tour for Nicholas Stanley-Price. </p> <!--
/wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In street, early surface ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_802]) above yellow preparation fill ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_803]) is removed; yellow fill itself begins to be removed.
Soil seems to be close to bedrock, many large stones, deep deposit --
maybe major road reworking (see sketch opposite for current
stratigraphy). This seems to come down on another use surface ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_818]), although by the end of the day only a little bit on
the SW side has been revealed. Not yet clear how far from bedrock this
layer is.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In room 38, the dark brown fill ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_785]) continues. In the W corner of the trench, it comes down
on a very distinct patch of gray ash with a greasy texture and charcoal
inclusions ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_808]). This ash is photographed in
conjunction with the edge of a large stone ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_820])
on which it sits, but it does not get a layer photo.&nbsp; The stone
itself seems to sit in more fill, since cleaning reveals a void below
&amp; between it and some adjoining stones in the fill. There is a hard
patch along the SW side of the room which seems to be delimited to the
NE by a line (layer?) of friable yellow clay below the brown fill -- not
yet clear if this is a separate layer bounded by a cut. (see sketch
opposite). The ash is removed by the end of the day -- it seems to be a
relatively thin layer. On the other side of the bedrock ridge, in the N
corner of the room, 606 ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_606]) continues to be
removed. In the area where the pebble-and-sea-ceramic "surface" was
found, a large number of ceramic fragments worn by the sea continue to
be found. Below this layer appear two new layers -- one is a very
distinct deposit of charcoal and yellow powdery lumps that C<em>[hris]
</em>S<em>[alter]</em> id<em>[entifie]</em>'s as potassium sulfate, an
iron corrosion product ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_831]). This seems to sit on
top of a hard-packed brown surface in the very N corner  ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_827]). </p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p><em>[p. 72: middle of the page: sketch of the
top plan of the layers in the N part of the courtyard trench; below,

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p><em>[p. 73]</em></p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>6 July 2006 cont.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>At the same time, on the other side of the
final-phase pit, Ishan begins to remove an equivalent deposit of 606
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_606]). There, however, the two new layers are not
in evidence, and all the soil seems to be the same brown fill. Visible
in the section under the final-phase staircase, and probably removed in
2005, is a thin layer of red soil with on its surface an even thinner
layer of ash &amp; charcoal. This is almost certainly a burnt patch from
a fire, though whether it was a hearth or a single event is unclear
<em>[ed. note: apparently never documented stratigraphically; no context
number in database]</em>. It also seems to represent a phase before the
interior stairs were constructed. </p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In room 31, further cleaning of the tile and
floor/surface deposit ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_795]) of the 6th c. reveals
that the structure in the S corner is, as in 37, a layer of greasy gray
ash sitting on top of a clay construction. This construction seems to
sit on (be set in?) a lower, more regular surface with an ashy
gray-brown color &amp; many charcoal inclusions ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_811]). It is possible that the layer above was abandonment or
destruction, and that this is the actual 6th c. floor surface. </p> <!--
/wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In room 31a, I excavate the layer of mixed soil
&amp; decayed bedrock ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_807]) over real (?) bedrock.
The latter has an irregular, pitted, and heavily eroded surface that
slopes down from three sides to the middle. As far as I can see there is
no trace here of the massive cut that is visible on the other side of
wall 399 ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_399]). What little pottery there is seems
to suggest a late date (glazed fragments).</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In the courtyard, Shawn begins to remove the
material from the foundation trench ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_763]) of the
walls along the NE side of the NW segment of the courtyard. The first
level of fill ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_762]) seems to have been distinct,
and one fill episode seemed yesterday to cut another. The boundaries
bore no relation to the wall segments, however, and this idea seems
difficult (see sketch opposite). It was clear, however, that in the
horizon between the 1st ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_762]) and 2nd ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_804]) fills (?), there was a large patch of ashy soil
containing plaster and large intact animal bones ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_805]). This fill occupied a wider area at the NW end of the
construction trench, and did seem fairly clearly to lie over the softer
brown fill ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_804]) in the rest of the foundation
trench. Over the rest of the area, the second level of surface
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_757]) is removed down to the yellow layer
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_759]) that covered the area on the other side of
the section wall. The surface of this layer is more irregular -- in the
center of the court, it seems to dip down, either as the result of a cut
or naturally. The layer above fills this depression or cut as well (no
separate fill context can be identified). Although there does seem to be
a clear edge along the NE side, the lack of a cut edge on the other side
suggest to me that this is a natural slope rather than an artificial
one. Along the wall of complex 1, Karissa also finds a new feature -- a
lump of yellow-orange clay or bedrock marl that is initially taken to be
cut by something but later thought perhaps to be a structure, or part of
one, buried beneath the current layer.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>No work in the church today.</p> <!--
/wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In W wing of room 31, Sasha finishes removing
the decayed bedrock layer ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_717]). Among the finds
from the yellow fill below that rock ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_809]) is a
stamped Hellenistic amphora handle of Chers. manufacture (see sketch
opposite).</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph
--> <p>In the street, the yellow fill ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_803]) on the
NE side comes down onto what seems to be a layer of charcoal and burnt
soil ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_818]) similar to the layer on the SW side.
This morning the remains of the brown fill ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_778])
for the construction trench of the drain are also removed. The burnt
surface seems to cover another thin deposit of yellow soil ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_836]) that in turn covers bedrock.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In room 38, the odd yellow patch ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_831]) is further cleaned -- the ash, charcoal patches, and
mixed yellow &amp; orange material is assigned its own context number
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_810]), since the yellow material clearly forms a
single, clean, consistent patch beneath it. This patch -- bordered with
the same rust-colored material as was visible above -- is sampled,
documented, and removed as a unit. Under it seems to be an ashy layer
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_839]) (by the step down to the pit) and a
hard-packed surface ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_827]) (by the N corner of the
room). (see sketch opposite).</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In room 31, a floor ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_811])
below the final surface contemp<em>[orary] </em>w<em>[ith] </em>use of
the hearth ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_800]) is uncovered. By the hearth is a
patch of black hearth ash ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_825]) lying on an
earlier surface ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_835]) -- contemp<em>[orary]
</em>w<em>[ith] </em>first phase of hearth, or left</p> <!--

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>on surface before const<em>[ruction] </em>of
hearth? The same surface also has a patch of black ash rich in
hammerscale ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_829]) next to a fragmentary iron
object ([ark_link sfi=CH06SR_3683]). Both ash patches are sampled (one
for paleobot<em>[anical remains]</em>, one for metallur<em>[gical
remains]</em> ([ark_link smp=CH06SR_579])) and surface is removed. In
the W wing, Sasha continues to remove the fill of the bedrock trench.
Under the decayed bedrock 717 ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_717]) was a layer of
yellowish soil with bedrock bits ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_809]); under this
are two layers, one light tan layer with no number <em>[later assigned
[ark_link cxt=CH06SR_844]]</em> and one dark brown compact layer
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_828]). The latter seems to cover the former (see
sketch opposite). From 828 comes the base of a black gloss plate with a
graffito ([ark_link sfi=CH06SR_3685]) -- ligature of several letters
(see sketch opposite).</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In the courtyard, the upper yellow layer 759
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_759]) is cleaned. In the N corner, it is covered
by the same ashy grayish layer <em>[possibly [ark_link cxt=CH06SR_755]?]
</em>that was visible in the initial sample trench. Along the SW wall
(complex 1), it seems to run into a layer of more rubbly, rocky soil
with bone fragments; this soil is looser, but of a similar color and it
cannot initially be distinguished from 759. </p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

work on plaster in the nave while Kathleen excavates disarticulated
human remains in a layer of compact gray soil (final use surface?) in

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph
--> <p>I am working in the courtyard today to try to speed things up.
That entry will be substantially more detailed than the others.</p> <!--
/wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In the stenopos, Anton et al. finish removing
the sandy light yellow fill ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_836]) under the thin
layer of ash &amp; reddish burnt soil ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_818]) that
seems to form the earliest flat surface of the street. The sandy soil
comes down onto irregular bedrock that seems to slope down to the N from
the S on the SW side of the street, and in an irregular slope from the
NE on the NE side of the street. It is difficult to imagine that this
was an original Greek street surface, although there is Hellenistic
material just over bedrock in the yellow fill. The box drain seems
almost certainly to be medieval in date -- it sits on the bedrock edges
of a cut ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_787]) presumably made at the same
time.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In room 38, the hard-packed beaten-earth
surface ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_827]) in the NW side of the room begins to
be excavated. Under it is a layer of rubbishy fill ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_840]) like that in the other filled rooms. A flotation sample
from this layer produced&lt;s&gt; a bone carving of an eros with wings
(see sketch opposite) <em>[ed. note: this statement is incorrect; the
bone eros ([ark_link sfi=CH06SR_3704]) came from flotation sample
[ark_link smp=CH06SR_577] from a layer ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_819]) at
the very bottom of the larger cut in the south part of the room]</em>.
Not yet any indication of layers in this area.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph
-->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In room 31, in the E wing, further removal of
surface under ash patches   ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_835]). In the middle
of the square of loose soil over which the stove was built, Dyma &amp;
co. find a tiny lamp set right-side up with traces of burning on the
spout ([ark_link sfi=CH06SR_3696]). Under this floor there appears to be
another surface w<em>[ith] </em>traces of black ash ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_842]) (but check current status w<em>[ith]</em> Dyma). In the
W wing, Sasha continues to remove 828 ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_828]); below
it, above the light tan fill layer ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_844]), is a
layer of grayish ashy soil with a larger proportion of charcoal <em>[ed.
note: later determined to be the same as 828; see entry for <a
href="http://chersonesos.la.utexas.edu/?p=414">11 July
2006</a>]</em>.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p><em>[p.78: upper part of page: sketch top plan
of layers in N end of courtyard; lower part of page: sketch top plan of
layers in N end of room 38]</em></p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p><em>[p. 79]</em></p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>10 July 2006 cont.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In the courtyard, 759 ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_759]) is fully removed, and the edge of the well cut
([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_736]) is cleaned. The fill (?) of this cut is a
brownish-black muddy soil, and I am assuming that it's material eroded
into the cut over the winter (and therefore do not keep any material).
The rain yesterday has also made the stratigraphic situation clearer
along the NE side of the area -- there it becomes abundantly clear that
the foundation trench ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_763]) was under-excavated
initially, and that it is in fact not an irregular line but a perfectly
regular trench ca. 40cm wide. Shawn and I remove the remaining fill
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_762]) and Allyson redraws her plan.&nbsp; It is
possible -- though not very likely -- that [ark_link cxt=CH06SR_759]
actually covered most of this trench fill, and that the portion
excavated earlier was excavated out of phase where it sloped up against
the wall. I think, however, that the layer was simply missed during
excavation. In the same way, the rubbly concentration ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_837]) midway between the two section walls along the NE wall
of the court can now clearly be seen to be the fill of a robbing trench
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_841]) which has removed some larger earlier wall.
The cut itself seems to cut the lighter, harder yellow layer below 759
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_772]) -- which is probably equivalent to the Early
Byzantine use surface encountered in rm 37 and at the excavated NW end
of the courtyard ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_715]). On the other side, there
is a cut in decayed/clayey bedrock which probably represents not the
robber trench but the original rock-cut foundation trench of the
structure that may have been located here. Around the well there are
also traces of straight edges that suggest a square enclosure or
well-head at some point in time (see sketch opposite). I also remove the
small piece of section at the junction between the early Byz<em>[antine]
</em>wall ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_692]) over the slabs ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_666]) and what appears to be an earlier wall ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_944]) under the complex 1 wall ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_296]) --
there is an inside corner here, though we will have to clean the surface
to see if there is a bond.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph
--> <p>Work finished in stenopos -- Petya drawing both sections.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In room 38, a little confusion: several layers
seem to be in play at different points in the NW side of the room, not
nec<em>[essarily] </em>being excavated consecutively. In the W corner,
the second fill layer <em>[ed. note: despite confusion in excavation in
this area, probably [ark_link cxt=CH06SR_827]) </em>seems to cover a
more or less vertical layer of yellow clayey soil ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_838]) packed along the face of the bedrock wall -- a stone
set in it suggests that it may be a facing for the cut, but it is
partially excavated with the fill. The gray ashy layer near the door cut
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_839]) is also overexcavated with the fill above in
this area, and a similar (?) soil filling a large cavity in the bedrock
face is also excavated as that fill. Along the NE side of the NW part of
the room, the situation is clearer -- the brown fill ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_827]) comes down onto the continuation of the ashy soil in
the doorway ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_839]), although with more clay and a
more compact appearance. The gray soil seems to cover, on the other
side, a very, very clear beaten-earth surface ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_847]) -- though this surface is also apparently under the
fill that is currently being excavated in this area <em>[ed. note:
apparently [ark_link cxt=CH06SR_827] here too] </em>(hence the general
confusion). There are clearly a series of independent actions taking
place on this side of the room, in contrast to the unitary fill on the
other -- but it will be difficult to reconstruct their sequence &amp;
chronology at this point. (see sketch opposite).</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In the E wing of rm 31, the early
Byz<em>[antine] </em>floor ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_835]) is removed,
revealing another floor ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_842]) with a stone
construction  ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_843]) on (?) it. This construction
is not yet clear, but it involves a piece of vessel or pipe set
concave-side down and open (flue?), and its surface seems to be at least
partially covered with a thick, heavy, smooth white substance (bedrock
or something else?). Another lamp ([ark_link sfi=CH06SR_3711]) found
under the stove. In the W wing of room 31, Sasha contines to excavate
fill ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_828]) -- he has decided that the gray ashy
soil we observed yesterday was merely a lens or series of lenses, and
*ALTHOUGH TODAY'S PALEOBOT<em>[ANICAL] </em>SAMPLES WERE FROM THAT ASHY
PATCH, they have gone in as 828 as well. The material being removed in
the NE end of the cut today is also being considered 828. </p> <!--
/wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In the courtyard, the fill ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_837]) of the robber trench ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_841]) across
the SE end of the area now open is removed -- rocky brown soil full of
bone and ceramics and a particularly large number of oyster shells.
Although this fill is more or less consistent across the trench, and
although on the E side it was certainly covered by the layer above
across this area ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_759]), I still have doubts about
the SW end. There were fragments of ceramic etc. much higher at this end
than at the other, and in the section below the wall <em>[of complex 1]
</em>it seems that part of the fill may in fact reach the area just
below the 12th c. wall. To the N, however, the yellow above elsewhere
also seems to cover this fill in the section -- so we should simply
mention the possibility of contamination and the possibility that this
trench is actually later than that upper yellow surface ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_759]). Once the fill is removed, we begin to remove the
yellow early Byz<em>[antine] </em>occupation/abandonment layer 772
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_772]). On the SW side, it comes almost immediately
down onto bedrock; on the NE side of the well, it is 20-25cm deep and
comes down onto a lighter yellow soil with patches of medium-gray ash
<em>[ed. note: possibly [ark_link cxt=CH06SR_848]?]</em>. The soil on
the other side of the robber trench, above the decayed bedrock, is
similar, although it may have some extra recent trample pressed into the
surface. It is clear, however, that a small segment of the 12th c.
foundation trench remains unexcavated. In it is a large piece of
charcoal, which we take as a possible dating sample.</p> <!--

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Anton et al. move to the church, where they
continue to remove the gray soil ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_798]) below the
use level in the apse. This soil is full of disarticulated human bone,
even below the altar support -- either this bone was kicked around
during excavation and reexcavation of the tombs, or it and the bones in
it were brought -- intentionally from another church or less
intentionally from t. 5 -- from elsewhere &amp; included in the
construction material when the church was built.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph
--> <p>Entry written after end of working day -- most of day spent in
courtyard trying to get enough done for Chris Salter's work. </p> <!--
/wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In room 38, the rest of the yellow packing clay
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_826]) is removed so that Allyson can draw the
feature in the bottom of the cut. It appears that I removed this clay at
the same time as a hard-packed brown soil underneath it -- probably an
entirely different layer, rather than simply a lower level of sediment.
Only a small patch in the N corner of the cut is left for levels and the
taking of material separately ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_857]) -- but its
original extent was more or less as in the sketch opposite, including a
narrow band covered by clay along the lip of the feature (see sketch).
On the NW side of the bedrock ridge, Lea thinks they might have reached
a surface on the E side of the space -- but only part of the area is
packed down, &amp; that could simply be from trample during work. The
rest looks very much like the soil that has been removed above -- a
fairly moist, compact, clayey soil with yellow and gray inclusions,
substantial amounts of charcoal, and a large quantity of pot &amp; bone
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_840]). In troweling along the NE wall of the
bedrock cut, I come across a very deep cavity ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_864]) filled with a much looser, loamy soil ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_863]) containing a number of Hellenistic sherds. This soil is
given a separate context number; some is removed now, the rest will be
removed when the level in the cut is lower. There is some confusion
about the floor of the pit from last year ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_668]) --
levels suggest that it is 10cm above where they are now, and that the
coin they found in the pedestal under the stone belongs to the tile
collapse -- but this seems unlikely, since the tile collapse was well
above the stone. Need to check documentation, esp<em>[ecially]
</em>photos.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In room 31, work stops in the E wing to focus
on the removal of the largely sterile tan soil ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_852]) with large white bedrock spalls filling the lower layer
of the bedrock trench</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p><em>[p. 84: full page sketch top plan of the
cuts and layers in the whole courtyard; legend: "asterisks represent

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>13 July 2006 cont.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>in the W wing. A bedrock floor covered by a
thin layer of ashy gray and yellow clay ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_867])
appears in the NW end by the end of the day.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Note: some of the stones have fallen off the
top of wall 399 ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_399]), revealing what seems to be
an actual face deep within what we have taken as the face. It may be
that this wall was not in fact unnaturally wide, and what we understood
as the inside face was actually articulated collapse from one or more of
its courses.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In the courtyard, Ishan and I begin to remove
the dark black to gray-brown ash ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_509]) that covers
the entire SE half of the remaining unexcavated part of the courtyard.
We focus on this area to provide C<em>[hris] </em>S<em>[alter] </em>with
enough information to finish his work. The layer is much deeper to the E
and SE, and it seems to cover both a compact very dark brown layer
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_884], probably also [ark_link cxt=CH06SR_877]) and
a more pebbly, loamy medium-brown soil to the SW, towards the cistern
and the wall of complex 1 ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_883]). It varies in
color from a dusty grayish-brown to almost pure black near the N corner
of the cistern. We also remove a thin layer of pebbly, friable tan soil
with some plaster content ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_858]) along the SE
trench wall -- it seems to sit on top of the ash ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_509]), though in fact it may have sat on top of the dark
brown ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_884]), as did the ash. Below the
brown-gray-black soot in this area is also a layer containing a large
amount of white mortar or plaster ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_885]). We
collect a large quantity of small pieces of slag from the courtyard in
this area, as well as four or five hearth bottoms, most of which were
shot in with the total station and their point data put on their bags.
This layer -- 509 as last year ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_509]) -- is
particularly rich in various sorts of animal bones, as well as
pottery.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>On the other side of the section wall, the last
of 782 ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_782]) is cleaned, revealing even more pits
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_856], [ark_link cxt=CH06SR_862]). The potential
pit near the well is a pit ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_854]), as is a larger
pit in the 12th c. foundation trench ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_860]) and a
smaller, squarish pit at the corner of that trench &amp; the robber
trench ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_866]). One of these pits ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_860]) contains a large quantity of carbonized material
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_859]), which is sampled for flotation. Although
all are circular -- some very much so -- these pits are of varying
depths &amp; forms (some shallow, some two-tiered <em>[sketch of section
of such pit] </em>-- some with extra cuts at the bottom). They already
seem to have been filled in by the Early Byzantine period. The proximity
of several of these pits to the well suggests the following sequence:
robbing of slabs ---&gt; digging of pits ---&gt; filling of pits &amp;
construction of Byzantine use surface ---&gt; at the same time or later
than the last, the construction of the well. (see sketch from memory
opposite)</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In the church, at least four articulated adult
depositions can be identified. Most are in very bad shape (bone not well
preserved, much more crumbly &amp; easily disintegrated than bones in
all tombs excavated to date), and all seem to be set on another, lower
layer of disarticulated bones of both adults &amp; children. Still
unclear whether these skeletons were buried in the floor of the church
or redeposited during construction from another resting place. The soil
in the apse ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_798]) is removed down to bedrock;
disarticulated human skeletal material appears all the</p> <!--

interior reentrant angle between the apse and the "nave" of the church
appears to be an earlier wall -- at first looked like deeper foundations
for corners, but rest of apse rests on soil well above this level, and
the visible and protruding stones seem very much to be arranged in two
faces and in courses (see sketch opposite). At first Larissa thinks it
could be for an earlier dividing wall between apse &amp; nave, but too
far below the lowest level of the foundation of the rest of the apse
<em>[ed. note: further excavation suggests that these are not the
remains of the walls, but additional foundations for the base of the
arch that would have marked the boundary of the apse]</em>.</p> <!--

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph
--> <p>Entry written on 17 July -- working in morning.</p> <!--
/wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In room 38, 840 (fill) ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_840]) continues to be removed -- no sign of a use surface
equivalent to that on the W end of this side of the room. When Lea et
al. draw even with the level of the floor surface of the pit, however,
it becomes clear that the pit was not fully excavated in 2005 -- the
line of the fill ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_868])/cut clearly continues
around its original extent, below the current level of 840. At the same
time, the brown hard-pack below the yellow clay ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_826]) in the deeper pit is removed, and the remaining soil is
removed from around the cover (?) stones over the cut in the floor of
the cut <em>[the previous sentence refers to the pit in the SE half of
room 38]</em>.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In room &lt;31a&gt; <em>[this must be an error
for "31", W wing]</em>, the final layer of clayey fill/deposit
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_867]) over the bedrock at the bottom of the
rock-cut trench is removed -- this side of the room is complete.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In the courtyard, the final areas of the second
section are cleaned. 509 ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_509]) is removed from the
third section, but there may have been some confusion here. Although 509
is the ashy soil familiar from 2005, it seems to have no particular
boundary with the hard-pack at the NW end of this section -- just fades
into it, and both are removed at the same time and as 509. It remains to
be seen whether we will be able to differentiate between 509 and 752
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_752]), the number given to the upper soil in the
2nd section <em>[of the courtyard]</em>. Furthermore, a large ashy patch
in the NW part of the third section has a deposit below 509 removed at
the same time as 509, since it comes down onto black soil (which is
serving as the layer indicator). I think that the stratigraphic
situation is as sketched opposite, with 509/752 ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_752]) covering a deposit of gray-brown soil ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_876]) which in turn covers more ash ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_877]). In addition, a wall (?) ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_922]) is
also uncovered along the SW side of the third section; to the NW of this
series of three stones is a patch of white hearth ash ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_882]). We initially think there is a border along the NE
side, too, but this turns out to be only one stone that soon comes
loose. This feature is clearly cut by what seems to be the foundation
trench ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_943]) of the NE wall of complex 1
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_296]); on either side of it are patches of harder
brown or brownish-yellow soil ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_929]) (see sketch
opposite).</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_798]) continue to be excavated. Several rest

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph
--> <p>Again, entry written on following day -- things getting busy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In room 38, the final layers of fill in the odd
cut ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_874]) in the bottom of the large cut on the SE
side of the room are removed. This fill ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_819]) is
wet, directly over yellow clay ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_826]) that seems to
form part of the natural clay seam Dyma encountered in the well <em>[in
the courtyard in 2005]</em>. Under the lower parts of the stone slabs
over this cut is a roughly circular arrangement of tiles and small
stones ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_875]), also set into yellow clay beneath
brown fill. This structure was photographed &amp; photomodelled but not
drawn (see sketch opposite). On the other side of the bedrock ridge, the
actual bottom of the pit ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_601]) is cleaned -- now
all visible layers in that area (except the beaten-earth floor
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_847])) are the same tan-greenish clayey fill 
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_879]).</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In room 31, E wing, surface 872 ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_872]) is excavated -- it is the surface on which the last two
clay &amp; stone constructions stand, and it also includes fill to a
depth of ca. 30cm (floor surface beaten into or trampled onto upper
layer of fill).</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Sasha begins excavation of what we will call
"rm 31 probe" -- essentially a wall-chasing trench ca. 1.5m wide just
over &amp; to the NW of the line of the SW wall of room 38, extending
ca. 4m to the NW. We are attempting to locate the other side of room 31,
in an area where we know the archaeological deposit is thin (and mainly
composed of rubble). See sketch opposite.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In the courtyard, the gray-brown soil
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_876]) over the ash patch ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_877]) is removed and the ash patch itself is cleaned for
photos &amp; documentation. The rest of section 2 is also fully cleaned
for photography.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In the church, the last layer of depositions
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_798]) is removed &amp; the bedrock is cleaned.
This cleaning reveals the outline of a cut ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_902])
in the bedrock floor itself, above which there is a patch of burnt soil
&amp; charcoal that Anton identifies as a hearth (?)([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_881]). We also open the deposit of human bones from the area
of the wall of the chapel &amp; the street (located in 2002 but not
excavated) ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_911]). The 2002 fill is removed.</p>

cxt=CH06SR_875]) in hole in large cut, cleaning of remaining brown soil
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_821]) (also found under tiles &amp; stone of this
construction . Work now concentrates on fill  on other side of bedrock
ridge, now that rest of pit removed -- beaten-earth floor on SW end of
area removed, work begins on the uniform layer of fill ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_879]) now exposed (though exposed in a
not-particularly-chronological manner). Finds include a bronze bell
([ark_link sfi=CH06SR_3838]) &amp; a group of stones mortared together
(saved as an architectural sample).</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

separates layer above ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_872]) as another context,
since slightly more compact. That context covers two more circular pits
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_889], [ark_link cxt=CH06SR_892]) in the bedrock
floor of this room. In the room 31 probe, the line of the SW wall of rm

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In the courtyard, the ash patch ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_877]) is now clearly circular and when removal begins, it
becomes clear that the ash fills a regular pit ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_897]). In terms of sequence, this will be removed (comes down
onto a clear tan compact soil), followed by the fine dark-brown-gray
layer to the SE, followed by the construction trench for the wall of
complex 1. </p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In the chapel, the hearth area ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_881]) is removed and work begins on the wall between the
church &amp; the street ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_911]). The presence of
human remains in and around that wall fill suggest that the wall had
already been destroyed when the remains were deposited in the street.
The fill of the bedrock cut ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_902]) in the center of
the church also begins to be removed. Most of the fill ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_894]) is a hard gray-brown soil, but along the NW wall of the
church there is a very distinct layer of yellow soil filling a roughly
rectangular area between the corner of the apse &amp; the wall of tomb
1.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph
--> <p>In room 38, work continues on the removal of the yellow-brown
fill ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_879]) in the NW half of the room. Along the
SW wall, Dyma M. thinks the fill is slightly different, but it looks
very similar to me -- just less compact, as is usual at the edges of the
fills in this room. On the other hand, in this area, an initial removal
of another 10cm exposes a smoother, grayer, ashier soil with much less
material, at least in the S corner (possibly [ark_link cxt=CH06SR_908]).
It is difficult to say whether this is a different layer -- things are
moving slowly today and very little was exposed. On the other side of
the ridge, Emily removes the material from the second of the two bedrock
(semi-)circular cuts ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_901]). Below the millstone
([ark_link sfi=CH06SR_3843]) and a thick layer of brown fill ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_890]) is what appears to be a surface ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_895]), on top of which sit a coin ([ark_link
sfi=CH06SR_3866]) and a fragments of marble architectural decoration
(from a window frame or iconostasis?) ([ark_link sfi=CH06SR_3845];
[ark_link sfi=CH06SR_3846]).</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In room 31, the last soil is removed from the
two circular pits ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_889], [ark_link cxt=CH06SR_892])
at the bottom of the larger bedrock cut in the E wing. In the probe, the
line of a wall ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_946]) is followed, extending out
from the W corner of room 38 -- but it seems not to be quite in a line
with that wall, and I wonder if it doesn't indicate another seam between
complexes.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In the courtyard (third section), the situation
is both slightly clearer &amp; slightly more confusing. On the one hand,
the black ash ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_877]) clearly fills two conjoined
cuts, one a large oval &amp; the other a smaller circle ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_897]) -- both cut through a light tan-yellow layer ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_759]) and come down onto (decayed?) bedrock. Another pit -- a
rectangle with a circle at its W corner -- is identified in the E corner
of the area ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_905]); it too is filled with black ash
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_896]). This pit, like the smaller part of the
other pit, is covered by the dark brown soft powdery soil that occupied
most of the E quarter of the area ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_884]). This soil
also covers a hard tan soil to the NE ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_759]) and a
crumbly, pebbly brown soil to the SW ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_883]). The
foundation trench ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_943]) of </p> <!-- /wp:paragraph

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>18 July 2006 cont.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>the NE wall of complex 1 ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_296]) is also excavated -- it is a very shallow and fairly
narrow cut with an irregular bottom and a variable width. Although it is
unconvincing as a foundation trench, the wall (itself founded not on
large stones set flat but on medium-large irregular stones set upright
at a slight angle) does not go below its bottom, and therefore our
identification is probably correct. See sketch opposite (from memory at
end of day). There may also be yet another cut (or shallow depression)
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_904]) with an ashy, trashy fill ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_899]) along the middle of the NE section wall -- this may in
fact match an ashy patch ([ark_link cxt=CH05SR_576]) found on the other
side of that <em>[section] </em>wall last year.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph
-->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In the church, still some confusion over
remains in area of street wall and in apparent pit in the street
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_936]). Edges of that pit are indeterminate, since
street surface has been trampled, baked and hardened for four years --
but one side is lined with/filled with a very white mortar/concrete with
large stones, and we wonder if the intrusion might be modern.  In the
center of the church is a large cut in the bedrock, apparently a
circular pit attached to a larger, square (?) cut ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_902]). We begin to remove the fill ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_798]) between the tombs today -- the bedrock level is quickly
found at the end, but there are three skulls and disarticulated material
between that end &amp; the end closer to the apse. Ishan finds four
coins from the area between the foot of the tombs in the sieve
([ark_link sfi=CH06SR_3872], [ark_link sfi=CH06SR_3873], [ark_link
sfi=CH06SR_3875], [ark_link sfi=CH06SR_3885]).</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph

--> <p>In room 38, ongoing excavation of yellow-brown fill ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_879]). In the SW part of the NW part of the room, there is a
very hard &amp; smooth layer of clayey yellow soil ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_908]) that seems to be close to bedrock. This soil seems to
have an edge against a more friable, softer, slightly grayer yellow soil
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_906]), and the edge seems to be shared with the
bedrock beneath. The most reasonable explanation seems to be that the
grayer soil fills a cut in the smoother soil and the bedrock. This fill
seems to be cut in turn by another cut -- roughly squarish -- at the N
corner of the room, which is filled yet again by a fairly similar soil
(a moist clayey loam with lots of pottery and bone, as well as charcoal
and clay lumps) that is distinct primarily in its color (browner) and
compaction (looser) ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_910]). The bedrock appears to
be much lower on this side. (see sketch opposite)</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In the room 31 probe more confusing information
-- the large wall ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_946]) slightly off line with the
SW wall of&nbsp;38 ([ark_link cxt=CH04SR_264]) is abutted (?) at its NW
end by another wall that shows the sleeper-beam slot <em>[ed. note: this
section of wall was not assigned a separate number in the field]</em>.
This wall follows the same line to the NW -- still no sign of a
crosswall to close room 31.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

apparent collapse (?) or pile of 10th c. tile ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_915]) along the edge of the foundation trench ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_943]) cleaned while brown pebbly soil ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_883]) is removed. Tan-yellow soil in N corner (759?)
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_759]) also removed, seems to go down to bedrock --
but in this area we dig below the level of the three wall-stones
([ark_link cxt=Ch06SR_916]) left here, which now sit on an earth balk,
without identifying a contemporary surface or</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>a wall trench. I think this means we missed a
use surface -- the wall is very similar in construction to the other
Early Byz<em>[antine] </em>walls in this area, and all of those sat
directly on the surface present when they were built. At a later date
these walls were partially covered by the accumulation of interior &amp;
exterior surfaces -- but we don't have the surface to associate with the
initial construction. It's also a bit unclear what is going on to the S
of the line of wall ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_922]) and patch of white
hearth ash ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_882]) -- there is a somewhat tenuous
line of stones along the edge of the foundation trench, and then what
seems to be quite a deep deposit of the pebbly brown soil ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_883]) (I think Shawn may have associated this soil with 759
at the N corner, so we may be dealing with only one context at this
point). </p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In the church, the rest of the material
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_798]) between the tombs is cleared and the cut
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_923]) -- perhaps for the construction of tomb 1 --
is emptied. This leaves the square cut ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_920]) on
the NW side of the area in front of the apse; Anton has taken down at
least one level ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_903]), but the hard yellow-brown
soil ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_907]) continues to descend. We're going to
return in the afternoon to finish it. <em>[the notes on the facing page
represent an attempt to record findspots during after-hours excavation
when the total station was no longer set up; all of them are associated

structure rather than a fill. On the other side of the bedrock ridge,
the odd deposit of charcoal and yellow mineral (potassium sulfate?)
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_831]) is cleaned and the rest of 606 ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_606]) removed on both sides of the pit. </p> <!--
/wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In the W wing of rm 31, Sasha continues to
remove 809 ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_809]), the layer of yellow fill with
bedrock crumble. Many amphora fragments emerge, including another
stamped frag, this one a rim, perhaps also local (see sketch opposite).
In the E wing of room 31, the Early Byz<em>[antine] </em>stove/hearth
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_795]) is fully uncovered; on its surface is a
round spot of burnt red soil ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_814]) and gray ash
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_812]) which is given a separate number and then
removed. </p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In room 38, the cleaning at the bottom reveals
a gap between the two flat pavers/covers ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_820]) --
in the gap the brown fill ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_785]) continues, but the
stones and ceramics have a black encrustation that we initially took as
an indication of burning (looked like the black encrustation on stones
from well in courtyard). Gordana and Chris Salter, however, indicate
that such encrustation is a product of being exposed to the water table
-- either a sulfate-reducing bacteria (Gordana) or manganese leaching
out onto the objects (Chris). The bottom of this area seems to be below
the water table -- it is filled with a gray clayey mud ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_821]), and water actively begins to creep into it as we dig.
</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In the courtyard, the yellow layer ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_759]) is cleaned, and in its surface are found to be many
intrusions -- a circular hole/pit ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_834]) near the
well that seems to represent a tree or bush (root voids still visible
acc<em>[ording] </em>to Shawn); a large rectangular cut  ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_822]) in the center of the layer that disappears under the
section, shallow &amp; filled only with the layer above; and a long
narrow cut that also disappears under the section but seems to be filled
with a different material  <em>[ed. note: unidentified, not noted in
Marceaux daybook]</em>.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->]]></content:encoded>

opening celebration.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In room 38, brown clayey fill ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_910]) at NE end of room continues; along the NW side is a
harder, yellower outcrop ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_921]) that may represent
the edge of the cut (?) ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_909]) this material fills.
</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In the courtyard, ongoing removal of brown
pebbly soil in S corner of section 3 ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_883]). It
covers bedrock in places and in others a hard yellow soil over bedrock
<em>[ed. note: it is not clear what layer this refers to; either this
layer was not recorded separately, or it is confusion with [ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_914]]</em>. It also seems to cover a more compact gray soil
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_929]) in the S corner, where it comes up against a
pile of stones &amp; rubble that may be the remains of another wall
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_922]). A small area of 759 (?) ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_759]) that remained along the section wall
b<em>[e]</em>tw<em>[een] </em>second &amp; third sections is also
removed, revealing another segment of wall at right angles to &amp;

the fill of the pit ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_936]) in the street. Along the

defined by the patch of mortar, which Yulia Strilenko thinks is not
modern; and the other two edges remain unclear. The fill ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_907]) in the bedrock cut in the center of the nave continues,
and this and the fill (still [ark_link cxt=CH06SR_798]) of a very
distinct cut ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_923]) along the wall of t. 1 continue
to be excavated.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph
--> <p>Entry written on 7/23 -- on both 21st &amp; 22nd I spent the
whole working day digging.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In room 38, the brown-yellow fill ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_910]) in the NE end of the pit to the NW continues to be
removed. It comes down to bedrock without any particular change in
character or consistency; the bedrock floor itself is very smooth.
Although the limits are difficult to find, there does seem to be an edge
along the NW wall of the cut in the area of the late Byz<em>[antine]
</em></p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p><em>[p. 96: upper part of the page: sketch plan
of layers in cut in N side of room 38; middle of page: sketch of NE
section wall of courtyard; bottom part of page: sketch plan of layers
and walls in courtyard]</em></p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p><em>[p. 97]</em></p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>21 July 2006 cont.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>pit in this area. The soil here ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_921]) is denser, yellower, and more compact. The finds,
however, are similar -- a lot of Hellenistic residual material mixed
with quantities of animal bone and Late R<em>[o]</em>m<em>[a]</em>n -
Early Byz<em>[antine] </em>ceramics. It is possible that we overcut the
yellow layer during the excavation of the browner soil, but in the
profile streaks of yellow seem to be interwoven with streaks of brown,
and it may also be that this layer is not an earlier fill cut at a later
period, with that later cut then filled, but simply an area of generally
mixed fill with a slightly different character (see sketch opposite).
</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In the courtyard, further excavation makes the
situation a bit clearer. The yellow, fairly compact soil ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_782]?) between the wall fragment &amp; the section in the N
part of the trench is removed, but I think it is removed together with
an earlier surface in phase with the wall itself. We hope to establish
this in the section. It becomes clear that the pebbly brown soil
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_883]) exists in an area that is roughly a
quarter-circle expanding out from the cistern; that it is covered by the
layer of soil with white bedrock chunks along the SE side of the trench
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_885]); and that it covers in turn 1) a pile of
small-medium stone rubble running in a fairly well-defined line along
the wall of complex 1 ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_929]); 2) the fill of the
very large pit in the center of the courtyard <em>[ed. note: this seems
to refer to [ark_link cxt=CH06SR_877], but if so the database and GIS
suggest that the statement is incorrect and the relationship between the
two is not direct]</em>; and 3) the fill of two smaller pits, one under
the stone rubble at the S corner ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_927]) and the
other -- with 3 hearth floors -- in the center of the courtyard near the
SE side ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_925]) <em>[ed. note: this statement also
seems to be partially incorrect, since it was later determined that 925
was (also?) covered by [ark_link cxt=CH06SR_914], which was also
determined to cover 883]</em>. This suggests to me that the brown pebbly
soil is contemporary with the early phase of Late Byz<em>[antine]
</em>activity in the courtyard -- but we'll wait for the ceramics
results. On the other side of the other small wall stub ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_922]) (along the wall of complex 1), the pile of tiles &amp;
pithos frags ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_915]) are found to cover the gray ash
layer ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_882]), which in turn covers what appears to
be a relatively smooth use surface ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_782]). This use
surface exists mainly along the SW side of the area, and it also seems
to cover the fill of the large pit in the center and the pile of
small-stone rubble along the same wall <em>[ed. note: the relationship
between the smooth surface ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_782]), the upper layer
of ash above the large center pit ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_877]), the
pebbly brown soil ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_883]), and the rubble fill
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_929]) was not established in a satisfactory manner
during excavation; both 782 and 877 appear in the database as covering
the fill of the large pit ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_912]), but the
relationship between the two was not identified]</em>. The situation
here is extremely confusing, but some relative sequences can now be
worked out (see sketch opposite).</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In the church, final excavation of pit in
bedrock under nave ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_920], fill [ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_907]), trench along wall of t. 1 ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_923]);
ongoing excavation of human remains in pit in street ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_936]). The edges of this pit still have not been defined, and
the human remains continue much deeper. An area of mortar projecting at
the upper SW edge of this cut seems to continue below, as if the pit had
been lined with this mortar deliberately. Still not clear when this
intrusion happened, since no modern finds indicate recent
disturbance.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->]]></content:encoded>

<description></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph
--> <p>In room 38, the bedrock floor at the NE end of the cut along the
NW wall is more or less cleaned, and sections are straightened in this
area. We then begin to remove the area of denser yellower soil along the
NW section &amp; between the NE &amp; SW ends of the cut ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_921]). This soil, too, seems to cover a layer of
abandonment/accumulation (??) over the bedrock floor of the cut [NB: I
cannot now remember</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p><em>[p. 98: upper part of page: sketch plan of
bedrock and cuts in N part of room 38; middle of page: sketch of section
along and under NW wall of room 38]</em></p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p><em>[p. 99]</em></p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>22 July 2006 cont</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>if the layer over the floor was under this
section or under the edge of the brown fill, or both -- need to check
photos, section, and L<em>[ea] </em>C<em>[line]</em>'s documentation].
Material in this fill seems similar to the material in the fill removed
previously ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_910]). When this fill has been removed,
the ashy yellow soil ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_908]) above the bedrock ledge
at the SW end of the cut is cleaned &amp; documented; it seems to
preserve evidence of burning or ash in several places, as well as at
least one large fragment of a mortarium lying face-down on the surface.
When this layer is excavated, we begin to notice that it is full of very
tiny fish bones -- at least three float samples are taken, so it'll be
necessary to get these results to the fish people.</p> <!--
/wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>This layer comes directly down to bedrock (it's
7-12cm thick); I notice that just on the surface of the bedrock there
seems to be some ash/evidence of burning. When fully cleared, the cut
has a ledge about 1/3 of the way from the SW wall, with very smooth
bedrock surfaces on both sides -- the one to the NE is about 1m-1.2m
lower than the one to the SW. If the section wall to the SW is reliable,
the higher part of the cut preserves the same NW wall as the trench in
31 ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_725]), but that wall disappears at the line of
the ledge (see sketch opposite).</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In the courtyard, the situation is increasingly
complex. The pit in the center of the courtyard ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_913]) begins to be emptied, as the last of the pebbly soil
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_883]) is removed from the rest of the trench. It
is filled by a layer of brown soil ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_912]), that in
turn covers a lens&lt;e&gt; of white ash in its W corner ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_917]); this ash covers a hard, dark, clayey gray-brown soil
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_918]) that fills the rest of the pit down to
bedrock -- though there is some distinction in its lower layers, where
it becomes increasingly clayey. There is also a lens or an interface of
small crushed shell at a certain point in the W corner of this layer,
but I will have to check w<em>[ith] </em>Shawn for its exact position.
The clayey layer -- the lower parts of which increasingly have the
aspect of burnt mudbrick -- covers an irregular structure of
medium-sized stones ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_934]) that appears to have
been built deliberately in the square part of this pit. Some mortar is
visible between these stones; a sample is taken for Yulia Strylenko. The
stones seem to form a transverse wall and a small circular wall (see
sketch opposite <em>[actually on following page]</em>), and it is
possible that some of the (burnt?) clay around them served either as
facing for the wall or for a mudbrick superstructure. There are a large
number of shells in this layer ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_918]), and both the
shells and the stone have a bright white, somewhat powdery surface
(calcinated?). At the S end of the pit, the bedrock cut is slightly
higher, with a (posthole?) cut in its S corner. At the E corner is
another large, round cut ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_931], filled by [ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_930]) partially in the bedrock and partially -- it appears --
in the fill of the square cut (&amp; hence later). Part of the bottom of
this cut is in a hard, bedrock-like material, but this may simply be a
product of the way it was cut into the fill (alternatively, it is
possible that the two cuts were made at the same time). </p> <!--
/wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In the church, Anton continues to excavate the
pit full of human bones ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_936]). Its edge to the SW
has not been clearly established. It is very deep and goes down to
bedrock, cutting the bedrock on the NE side. </p> <!-- /wp:paragraph

cuts and wall remains in the courtyard]</em></p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p><em>[at top of page, after date: "(entry

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Last half-day of excavation -- attempt to clear
courtyard. Final removal of fill in central pit ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_918]); also includes removal of clay/decayed bedrock <em>[ed.
note: not assigned a number during excavation] </em>that appears to fill
the narrow rectilinear cut that approaches the main square cut <em>[ed.
note: see GIS for position]</em>. This particular task is somewhat
confusing: although the orange-tan clay does seem to fill a cut in the
bedrock, it also has very irregular borders AND, most importantly, seems
to be part of the material cut by the wide foundation trench ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_841]) of the robbed wall. If this reading of the stratigraphy
is accurate, it creates serious issues for phasing, especially since the
mortar in the wall in the pit ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_934]) seems to be
non-Roman (чемянка, small gravel matrix, isn't characteristic). The cut
appears to continue up to the foundation trench, but could have been
overexcavated.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Along the wall of complex 1, we remove the pile
of small-small/medium stones ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_929]) on both sides
of the earlier wall-stub ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_922]). To the S, they are
simply a layer of stones in brown soil that covers a clean layer of
compact, slightly darker soil ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_927]) -- the other
part of the fill of the pit ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_928]) next to the
cistern. This is excavated completely, with the bedrock lip visible on
the other side. To the NW of the wall stub, however, there are two
different situations. Immediately next to it, the loose stones cover a
sandy tan-brown fill, also with some small stones ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_933]); this fill is located in a shallow, roughly rectangular
depression with its long axis parallel to the wall of complex 1
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_942]). As one moves along this cut/depression to
the NW, however, the stone packing becomes more dense and, in its lowest
levels, seems actually to be mortared together. I think that these
mortared stones ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_932]) are the remains of a wall,
perhaps a small wall associated with the functioning of the square cut,
or the very tenuous remains of an earlier structure in this area
<em>[ed. note: while the feature is not documented in the notebook, the
two fills in this area -- 929 and 933 -- also covered what was
interpreted as a single poorly-preserved mudbrick or clay packing
([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_935]) at the bottom of the cut]</em>. Finally,
cleaning of the courtyard reveals one last small, circular cut -- again,
perhaps a posthole ([ark_link cxt=CH06SR_945]) (see sketch opposite).
</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>The pit outside the church ([ark_link
cxt=CH06SR_936], filled by [ark_link cxt=CH06SR_938]) is still not
finished -- several bones are visible in the current wall.</p> <!--
/wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Pictures are taken from the crane today -- some
will be used for a general photomodel attempt.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph

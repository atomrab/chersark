I,Hellenistic I,last quarter of the 4th c. BC-second quarter of the 3rd c. BC,"construction and use of bedrock trench along NW side of rms 31 and 38; occupation of area, perhaps by private house (ceramics suggest mainly preparation and consumption of food and drink)",construction and occupation (public or private?),"high point in Late Classical/early Hellenistic, before Scythian problems",
II,Hellenistic II,no later than the end of the third quarter of the 3rd c BC,"deliberate filling of bedrock trench with soil containing fineware and amphora sherds, small fragments of red painted wallplaster (no Megarian bowl frags suggests before end of 3rd c)",modification or destruction,contraction during Scythian problems (epigraphy),
III,Hellenistic-Roman,200 BC-ca. 150 AD,period of abandonment represented by the deposition of concretized eroded bedrock over the fill of the Hellenistic trench; only one Hell. sherd of the 2nd c. BC found in all layers across the site,abandonment,further econ depression and contraction,
IV,Roman,ca. 150-250 AD?,"construction and use of pavement under room 37; slight but persistent activity indicated in ceramic and numismatic record, points to 2nd-3rd (ceramics), 3rd (coins); note that very few coins of the 2nd-3rd c in general",construction and occupation (public),Roman military presence (Pliny etc),
V,Late Roman/Early Byzantine,ca. 250-400 AD,"disuse of pavement and formation of soil use-layer probably associated with the construction and use of rock-cut industrial (?) facilities, pithos pits in courtyard, rooms 31/38; area used for dyeing, textile or skin processing, salting, pitch-boiling for boats?? Very large number of coins of 4th c from fills of these pits, suggests possible commercial activity",construction and industrial/commercial use,NEED HISTORICAL INFO FOR THIS PERIOD,
VI,Early Byzantine I,ca. 400-525 AD,"filling of the larger industrial facilities, although some single pithos-size pits remain open (for household use?); construction of domestic building over the pavement under rm 37, possible with its own vessel pits; use of large pithos pits in rm 31 as domestic space, possible use of reexcavated part of Hellenistic trench for domestic purposes; people in the houses involved in fishing, possibly metalwork (if patch of debris in EB house in rm 31, crucibles in its fill represent this)",modification and occupation (private),NEED HISTORICAL INFO FOR THIS PERIOD,
VII,Early Byzantine II,second-third quarter of the 6th c.,"domestic occupation of the area ends, possibly abruptly (cookpot left on floor in rm 31 house with food in it), remaining open pits filled in, area leveled; construction associated with t. 4 built? Does presence of large-scale architectural debris in the fill of eg room 31 indicate widespread damage to public buildings? if the cistern dates to this period, is there a connection? (note no coins later than 1st 1/4 of 6th c)",change of function of area (to what is unclear),multiple fills of 6th-7th c material date to this period: damage to the site (earthquake?) followed by Justinianic revival in Crimea (Procopius)?,

IX,Middle Byzantine II,10th c. AD,"Vladimir destruction?

(perhaps more likely contemporary with 12th c. construction)",construction and occupation (private),"post-Vladimir recovery, limited by political chaos and Seljuk problems in center and Anatolia; coins of Romanus Diogenes indicate connections with center around turn of 11th into 12th c.",

AD,"modifications in use and structure: parts of complexes 2 and 3 walled off and made independent (separation of commercial from private?), smithing activity ceases; ongoing burials in church (tombs 1 and 2, perhaps late burial in upper fill of tomb 5)",modification and occupation (private/commercial/religious),"fourth Crusade, Latin control of Constantinople, Mongols sack Kyiv, Chersonesos oriented to Trebizond?",
